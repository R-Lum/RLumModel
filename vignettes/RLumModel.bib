  Abstract                 = {We prepared an efficient YNbO4:Eu3+ phosphor using a simple solid-state reaction method and examined its photoluminescent properties in order to investigate the possibility for its usage in phosphor thermometry. Photoluminescence measurements were performed in the temperature range 303â803Â K, and the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) of the paired emissions lines of Eu3+ (5D1Â âÂ 7F1 and 5D0Â âÂ 7F1 transitions) was studied as a function of temperature. The sample crystalline structure is confirmed by \{XRD\} measurements. The material is proved to have a good potential for the development of thermographic phosphors. It exhibits maximum temperature sensitivity of approximately 3.5Â ÃÂ 10â3Â Kâ1 in the temperature region around 700Â K. },

  Abstract                 = {Plastic scintillators (PS) were made based on benzyl methacrylate and methyl-methacrylate P(BzMAÂ +Â MMA) copolymer in which the excimer forming rate is by two order lesser than that in polystyrene-based polymer matrix. Studying of these \{PS\} light yield demonstrates the importance of migration processes comparing to excimer formation. It is found that to obtain \{PS\} with high scintillation efficiency it is necessary to use the polymer base (matrix) in which excimer forming is eliminated but the migration process along the chromophores is maximally favored. To explain the accelerated energy transfer between phenyl chromophores it is proposed to use a mechanism of exchange of that virtual excitons that can propagate along a one-dimensional back-bone of polymer molecule. Clearing the details of mechanism of interaction between chromophores of polymer molecules which is responsible for accelerated radiationless energy transfer enable will determine in future the way of effective plastic scintillators designing. },

The dark current background and the counts obtained for a \{PM\} tube under constant illumination at various light intensities were measured. Where no divider is present in the counting system, the standard deviation of the number of counts exceeds the value predicted by a Poisson distribution but by different amounts in the different systems. This has implications for analysis of the uncertainties in the estimated equivalent doses and other quantitative analyses of luminescence measurements. We suggest how to account for the observed overdispersion of count numbers in uncertainty estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {The radiophotoluminescence (RPL) from aluminum oxide doped with carbon and magnesium (Al2O3:C,Mg) was investigated using different readout approaches. The systems explore either the 620Â nm (red) or the 335Â nm (UV) excitation bands of the F 2 + ( 2 Mg ) defects responsible for the \{RPL\} signal in Al2O3:C,Mg. For luminescence detection, we tested a photodiode and a fiber spectrometer. The results show that the \{RPL\} signal is linear over the dose range investigated (10Â mGyâ1Â Gy). The systems based on \{UV\} excitation have a lower background compared to the system based on red excitation, resulting in a higher signal to background ratio. The data from the fiber spectrometer system was analyzed using the area or a curve fitting of the F 2 + ( 2 Mg ) emission band. The curve fitting approach was able to better separate signal from background, allowing for higher signal to background ratios. The main challenge is to reduce the background signal contributed by instrumental background and background due to residual concentration of defects that could not be bleached. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In proton therapy, positron emitters are induced from 12C and 16O nuclei by protons on the beam path in the patient. Many studies for monitoring positron emitters with beam-induced \{PET\} technique have been performed by various groups to verify the proton beam range and the dose in the patient for quality assurance (QA). The \{QA\} methods proposed by some groups require accurate production cross sections of the positron emitters produced by protons, especially in the low-energy region. The aim of this study was to develop a method for measuring the production cross sections of positron emitters using standard equipment for proton therapy, and to measure the cross sections of positron emitters produced by low-energy protons and verify them in comparison with data of previous experiments. An 80-MeV proton beam was produced by a synchrotron, and the energy was degraded by polyethylene blocks to obtain various beam energies. The number of protons was estimated from the charge induced in a parallel-plate ionization chamber by protons. Low-energy protons of 14â70Â MeV were used to bombard 12C-rich and 16O-rich target materials: namely, polyethylene and gelatinous water. The time-activity curve was then measured by a high-sensitivity \{PET\} scanner to extract the number of positron emitters produced in the target. The production cross sections for four reaction channels: 16O(p, pn)15O, 16O(p, 3p3n)11C, 16O(p, 2p2n)13N, and 12C(p, pn)11C were then measured. The cross sections for the 16O(p, pn)15O reaction channel were consistent with data of previous experiments within the uncertainties, while those of 12C(p, pn)11C were generally lower than data of previous experiments. These results suggested that further measurements of the production cross sections will be necessary. },

  Abstract                 = {The gamma-ray tracking technique is a highly efficient detection method in experimental nuclear structure physics. On the basis of this method, two gamma-ray tracking arrays, \{AGATA\} in Europe and \{GRETA\} in the USA, are currently being tested. The interactions of neutrons in these detectors lead to an unwanted background in the gamma-ray spectra. Thus, the interaction points of neutrons in these detectors have to be determined in the gamma-ray tracking process in order to improve photo-peak efficiencies and peak-to-total ratios of the gamma-ray peaks. In this paper, the recoil energy distributions of germanium nuclei due to inelastic scatterings of 1â5Â MeV neutrons were first obtained by simulation experiments. Secondly, as a novel approach, for these highly nonlinear detector responses of recoiling germanium nuclei, consistent empirical physical formulas (EPFs) were constructed by appropriate feedforward neural networks (LFNNs). The LFNN-EPFs are of explicit mathematical functional form. Therefore, the LFNN-EPFs can be used to derive further physical functions which could be potentially relevant for the determination of neutron interactions in gamma-ray tracking process. },

  Abstract                 = {Russian citizens who were irradiated because of radiation disasters, nuclear weapons testing and some other sources have a right to some social support and financial compensation. In order to get this compensation people have to prove that they were irradiated. As it is, not all victims for a variety of reasons have formal documents. Thus they apply for cytogenetic investigation to prove irradiation months, years and even decades after irradiation. Since 1992Â the cytogenetic investigations related to radiation exposure were performed in \{NRCERM\} for more than 700Â people. At the beginning of this investigation \{FISH\} method was not certified as a biodosimenty test in Russia. Only dicentric analysis was approved as a proof of irradiation. It is known that the rate of dicentrics decrease in time, but the residual level of cytogenetical markers could be revealed a long time after a radiation accident. Thus the dicentric analysis was performed for the people who applied for biological indication of radiation exposure at that time. Rates of dicentrics exceeding control levels were revealed in half the people who applied for radiation conformation. Now \{FISH\} method is certified in Russia and both cytogenetic tests of biodosimetry (dicentrics and FISH) are available for all comers. Increased levels of translocations were found in 8Â cases (the dose rate from 0.16Â to 0.64Â Gy). On the basis of the results of cytogenetic tests official documents were supplied to these people and they were entitled to apply for radiation exposure compensation. Thus cytogenetic tests are very effective and in some cases the only possible way for the victims to prove irradiation exposure and to apply for radiation exposure compensation a long time after an accident. },

The emission spectra consist of intrinsic (excitonic) and defect related non-elementary bands in the VIS/UV range. It is shown that fast electrons create stable F and F+ color centers with characteristic emission and absorption bands in the visible/UV range. Induced absorption caused from these defects starts at 4.2Â eV. Energy transfer from host to color centers is not an efficient process. },

The doses immediately behind the ratchet wall are estimated by calculating the energy depositions in a water phantom that encloses the entire structure. Also estimated are the doses along the side wall and near the inner edge of the ratchet wall. The accumulated doses are calculated assuming various injection efficiencies to the storage ring and the number of electrons lost at the tapered copper absorber during injection.

  Abstract                 = {The first results concerning the potential of hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) as a new tool for the quantification and isolation of Black Carbon (BC) for radiocarbon analysis are reported. \{BC\} is a highly stable form of carbon, produced during pyrolysis of biomass to materials such as charcoal. Isolation and quantification of this component is therefore of great interest in radiocarbon measurement, particularly for more ancient samples, where contamination issues become more critical. Hypy has been demonstrated to reliably separate labile and refractory carbonaceous sample components for engineering and geological applications, but its potential in 14C geochronological investigation has previously been unexplored. Here, we test the hypy technique using a selection of soil standard samples and ancient charcoals from deposits of geological and archaeological significance. The results show that hypy can effectively and reproducibly isolate different carbon fractions within a variety of sample types and thus has the potential to provide a rapid and robust pre-treatment technique for radiocarbon analysis. Hypy has the additional advantage that the non-BC fraction removed from a sample can be quantitatively collected for subsequent further analysis. The technique represents a promising new approach not only for ensuring reliable decontamination of pyrogenic carbon samples prior to radiocarbon dating, but also for \{BC\} quantification in a variety of environmental matrices. },

Examining the source of sensitivity variations in these dosimeters allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the Landauer nanoDots and their potential for current and future applications. In this work, \{OSLDs\} were scanned with a MicroCT scanner to determine potential sources for the variation in relative sensitivity across a selection of Landauer nanoDot dosimeters. Specifically, the correlation between a dosimeters relative sensitivity and the loading density of Al2O3:C powder was determined. When extrapolating the sensitive volume's radiodensity from the \{CT\} data, it was shown that there is a non-uniform distribution in crystal growth. It was calculated that a 0.05% change in the nominal volume of the chip produces a 1% change in the overall response. Additionally, the âtrueâ volume of an OSLD's sensitive material is, on average, 18% less than that which has been reported in literature, mainly due to the presence of air cavities in the material's structure. This work demonstrated that the amount of sensitive material is approximately linked to the total correction factor. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An optimized geometry for the Monte Carlo simulation of a gamma-ray field in air created by any source distribution in the ground is applied. The soilâair medium of propagation is modeled using an optimized geometry that depends on the soil depth as the sole parameter. When this geometry is implemented, it is possible to track only those photons that are most likely to be detected. The variance in the radiation estimators is consequently reduced. The absorbed dose rates in air at 1Â m from the ground for a uniform source distribution are studied. The conversion factors for the natural series of 232Th, 238U and 4K are calculated and compared with previous calculations and with experimentally deduced values. The conversion factors for 137Cs sources exponentially distributed in the ground are calculated based on the results for planar sources at various depths. According to the optimization performed here, infinite planes are reduced to discs of decreasing radius. The obtained results are in agreement with the reference studies, although the size of the geometry-detector system was considerably reduced in this work. For the uniform distribution, the best agreement was achieved with the Monte Carlo results adopted by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU), although the emission volume of soil used in our case was 30,000 times lower. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The decrease of the luminescence efficiency with increasing temperature is known as the thermal quenching effect. Various materials exhibit thermal quenching, among which quartz and AI2O3:C stand as the mostly well known. BeO, which is used generally as \{OSL\} dosimeter, has been reported to undergo thermal quenching effect; so far in the literature only one thermal quenching parameter was determined using various \{OSL\} techniques. This study is the first attempt in the literature to calculate both W and C thermal quenching parameters. \{TL\} glow curves of BeO ceramic chips were studied as a function of heating rates ranging between 0.25 K/s and 8 K/s. The procedure of analysis includes various steps dealing with de-convolution of the quenched \{TL\} glow curves, correction for temperature lag, evaluation of the experimental thermal quenching parameter values, reconstruction as well as de-convolution of the reconstructed \{TL\} glow curves. The reconstruction step is really important, while its aim is twofold: (a) to provide the most stringent criterion for selecting the physically meaningful W,C values for BeO and (b) to check the kinetic parameters of the unquenched glow curve. The first peak of BeO is not affected by the thermal quenching, while both second and third peaks suffer from thermal quenching. W and C parameters were determined as 0.54–0.66 (±0.07) eV, 1.8 · 105–2.4 · 106 (±4 · 105) for peak 2 and 0.74–0.86 eV and 2.8 · 106–2.1 · 107 for peak 3 respectively for U-340 filter by using indirect fit method. The same process was applied for BG-39 filter and W and C parameters were compared to those found through U-340 filter. The values for the main dosimetric peak 2, are independent on the detection filter used, as well as in great agreement with the W values previously reported in the literature. The difference in the W, C parameters for those two peaks in BeO provide a strong argument to the fact that each one of these two peaks uses different recombination centers. According to the results of the de-convolution before and after the reconstruction, it is indicated that the influence of the thermal quenching is mainly reflected to the value of the activation energy for the case of peak 3, which is under-estimated without reconstruction. },

  Abstract                 = {An investigation of ambient dose at the Nuclear Medicine Department, Instituto Nacional de CancerologÃ¬a, Mexico, was performed using two types of thermoluminescent dosemeters: TLD-100 and TLD-900. In addition, ambient dose was measured at the outside corridor of the hospitalization room for 137Cs brachytherapy patients. Radionuclides used at the Nuclear Medicine Department are 131I, 18F, 67Ga, 99mTc, 111In, 201Tl. Main gamma emission energies from these elements are in the range from 93 to 511Â keV. High dose values were obtained at the waste storage room, the outside corridor of 131I patients, the PET/CT room and the outside corridor of 137Cs brachytherapy patients. The maximum ambient dose equivalent rate equal to about 19 Î¼Sv/h was obtained for the 137Cs brachytherapy corridor. Sites with minimum doses are the gamma camera rooms, having ambient dose equivalent rates equal to about 0.05 Î¼Sv/h. At most sites where both types of dosemeters were placed ambient dose equivalent values obtained with TLD-900 were 25â45% higher than TLD-100 values. This result was attributed to scattered radiation producing low energy photons which results in over response of TLD-900 and thus, TLD-100 values are considered to be more reliable. Knowledge of ambient dose values is relevant to the occupational exposure personnel who may limit the time spent at high dose areas. Recommendations were given to the Department authorities to implement actions in order to reduce doses at high dose sites in order to comply with the \{ALARA\} principle. },

The effect of FineView on modulation transfer function MTF, normalized noise power spectrum NNPS, and detective quantum efficiency \{DQE\} has been measured by some authors under different experimental conditions and their results do not always agree. We have evaluated the effect of FineView on these functions under rigorous standard conditions, following the 2007 \{IEC\} guidelines for \{DQE\} measurement in digital mammography detectors. We have also investigated the impact on \{DQE\} of the use of different beam spectra and the presence of the anti-scatter grid. Measurements were made with Mo/Mo, 28Â kV operating voltage, and 2Â mm Al at tube exit. \{MTF\} was obtained with the edge method, detector air-kerma \{DAK\} levels ranged from 60 to 272Â Î¼Gy, and the grid was set in or out, depending on the measurement. \{DQE\} values showed a dependence on \{DAK\} but were not significantly affected by FineView. The effect of the grid on \{DQE\} was of the order of 2% average difference and considered nonsignificant, while no effect of beam quality on \{DQE\} was observed at 200Â Î¼Gy, and 6% average difference was observed between 18.5 and 19.4Â keV mean energies at 60Â Î¼Gy, also considered nonsignificant. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Dosimetric phosphors of Cu-doped lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7:Cu) were produced using a sintering technique in a laboratory environment and characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD). The thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) properties of powdered (Li2B4O7) phosphor doped with copper at different concentrations (0.020â0.025Â wt %) were studied. The Cu-doped Li2B4O7 phosphor material has two dominant \{TL\} glow peaks, and the maximum \{TL\} responses of the peaks are at 115Â Â°C and 243Â Â°C in the range of 0Â Â°Câ310Â Â°C. The \{TL\} response of the Cu-doped lithium tetraborate is approximately 900 times more sensitive than undoped lithium tetraborate. The \{TL\} and \{OSL\} signal intensities increase as the beta radiation doses increase up to approximately 150.00Â Gy and 76.50Â Gy, respectively. The \{OSL\} doseâresponse curve is linear up to a dose range of 12.00Â Gy for Cu-doped Li2B4O7 dosimetric phosphors. The time-dependent fading behavior of the Cu-doped lithium tetraborate was found to be quite stable over long time durations. In addition, the repeatability of the \{OSL\} dose measurements were determined to be 2/3 lower compared to the \{TL\} measurements. The reproducibility of the \{OSL\} measurements was approximately 5%. Based on the \{TL\} and \{OSL\} results, the prepared phosphors can be used to measure beta doses ranging from 10Â Î¼Gy to 150.00Â Gy and 76.50Â Gy, respectively, by using the \{TL\} and \{OSL\} techniques, with confidence limits of approximately 7% and 3â4%, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An intercomparison of the performances of active neutron detectors was carried out in pulsed neutron fields in the new HiRadMat facility at CERN. Five detectors were employed: four of them (two ionization chambers and two rem counters) are routinely employed in the \{CERN\} radiation monitoring system, while the fifth is a novel instrument, called LUPIN, specifically conceived for applications in pulsed neutron fields. The measurements were performed in the stray field generated by a proton beam of very short duration with momentum of 440Â GeV/c impinging on a dump. The beam intensity was steadily increased during the experiment by more than three orders of magnitude, with an H*(10) due to neutrons at the detector reference positions varying between a few nSv per burst and a few Î¼Sv per burst, whereas the gamma contribution to the total H*(10) was negligible. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the linearity of the detector response in extreme pulsed conditions as a function of the neutron burst intensity. The results show that the ionization chambers have a quasi-linear response, very close to the ideal behaviour also for values of H*(10) of a few Î¼Sv/burst; the \{LUPIN\} response shows a slight deviation from the ideal curve when the H*(10) per burst is higher than 100Â nSv; the rem counters response are characterized by a strong deviation from the linearity for H*(10) values higher than a few tens of nSv. },

It should be noted that other ten reactors were also hit by the earthquake and tsunami but could reach cold shutdown owing to availability of cooling. Contamination of land and sea around the plant is so serious as that living and fishery are prohibited. Nevertheless, neither death due to radiation nor serious radiation exposure has been reported despite of various problems in the evacuation procedure and radiation management. Various actions which were undertaken to recover the plant and to reduce the radiation hazard to residents are also described. },

Luminescence characteristics of Pb-related centers of different types are identified.

Possible hypotheses on the origin of the intense complex lead-related blue emission are discussed. We propose phenomenological models describing the excited-state dynamics of the studied luminescence centers. We also determine characteristic parameters of the corresponding relaxed excited states, in particular, the energy separations between the excited states and the rates of the radiative and non-radiative transitions from these states. },

The acceptance angle of the pinhole collimator and the distance from pinhole to scintillator crystal were set to 45Â° and 60Â mm, respectively. The intrinsic spatial resolution and sensitivity were simulated by changing the pinhole diameter and channel height. The point source was located 60Â mm above the center of the pinhole, and the transmitted image was estimated for pinhole diameter values from 2.0Â mm to 4.0Â mm, while the channel heights were fixed between 2.0Â mm and 6.0Â mm. The optimal ranges of channel height and pinhole diameter were determined by evaluating the intrinsic resolution and sensitivity tradeoff curves. The pinhole parameters were selected based on these analyses, and we verified the simulation results through experimental tests of three types of collimators (general purpose, high sensitivity, and high resolution). The simulated and experimental results agreed, with discrepancies of 4.5% and 6.4% in the sensitivity and spatial resolution, respectively. The results demonstrate that the pinhole collimator designed in this study could be utilized to perform radiation monitoring. },

  Abstract                 = {We consider a problem of identification of nuclides from weak and poorly resolved spectra. A two stage algorithm is proposed and tested based on the principle of majority voting. The idea is to model gamma-ray counts as Poisson processes. Then, the average part is taken to be the model and the difference between the observed gamma-ray counts and the average is considered as random noise. In the linear part, the unknown coefficients correspond to if isotopes of interest are present or absent. Lasso types of algorithms are applied to find non-vanishing coefficients. Since Lasso or any prediction error based algorithm is inconsistent with variable selection for finite data length, an estimate of parameter distribution based on subsampling techniques is added in addition to Lasso. Simulation examples are provided in which the traditional peak detection algorithms fail to work and the proposed two stage algorithm performs well in terms of both the False Negative and False Positive errors. },

It is a technique requiring considerable experimental effort to yield dose estimates, primarily due to the complexity of the pre-dose effect on which it is based. Nonetheless it has important potential in the dating of ceramics of the last two millennia, in accident dosimetry and in the study of the role of defects in thermoluminescence processes. This paper examines recent uses of the technique including current research problems and wider implications of the results of pre-dose studies, in particular the study of the effect in minerals other than quartz. Several questions raised in recent papers on the basis of measurements with synthetic and natural alpha quartz and related to assumptions made in the use of the technique for dose evaluations are also discussed.},

The measured dose rates for three beta sources were compared with the corresponding values provided in the certificate by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the National Standard Laboratory of Germany. Depending upon the source and source-to-chamber distance, the \{PTB\} certificate values have uncertainties in the range Â±1.2âÂ±1.5%. The measured dose rates have uncertainties of about Â±0.3%. The deviations between the measured dose rates and the \{PTB\} certificate values compare well (maximum deviation is about 2%) considering the combined uncertainties associated with the measurements and the certificate values.

  Abstract                 = {The major uncertainty in relating cosmogenic-nuclide exposure ages to ages measured by other dating methods comes from extrapolating nuclide production rates measured at globally scattered calibration sites to the sites of unknown age that are to be dated. This uncertainty can be reduced by locating production rate calibration sites that are similar in location and age to the sites to be dated. We use this strategy to reconcile exposure age and radiocarbon deglaciation chronologies for northeastern North America by compiling 10Be production rate calibration measurements from independently dated late-glacial and early Holocene ice-marginal landforms in this region. 10Be production rates measured at these sites are 6â12% lower than predicted by the commonly accepted global 10Be calibration data set used with any published production rate scaling scheme. In addition, the regional calibration data set shows significantly less internal scatter than the global calibration data set. Thus, this calibration data set can be used to improve both the precision and accuracy of exposure dating of regional late-glacial events. For example, if the global calibration data set is used to calculate exposure ages, the exposure-age deglaciation chronology for central New England is inconsistent with the deglaciation chronology inferred from radiocarbon dating and varve stratigraphy. We show that using the regional data set instead makes the exposure age and radiocarbon chronologies consistent. This increases confidence in correlating exposure ages of ice-marginal landforms in northeastern North America with glacial and climate events dated by other means. },

Here, the dependence of the correction factor on the radiation energy is initially calculated for each type of emitted particle and with this result the correction factors for the 232Th and 238U series and 40K are determined. This analysis is made for dry soil and also for different levels of water content in it. The obtained beta correction factors for quartz are in good agreement with those previously reported. For the \{TLD500\} chip certain differences with previously reported data are found. The analysis of the gamma water correction factor for quartz based on Zimmerman equation shows the correspondence with the similar correction factor for electrons. In the case of \{TLD500\} chip a gamma water correction factor value of 1.0 was found. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation protection strategies for extended or deep space missions rely on accurate and robust estimates of exposure dose and corresponding risk to crew health, systems functions, and mission safety in general. Simulation and modeling of dose and risk associated with such exposures are, to various degrees, made difficult by the inherent complexity and variability in characterizing the radiation environment, its passage and interaction with matter, and its biological effects. One of the more important contributors to the overall uncertainty in dose or risk assessment is the empirical variability in the radiation quality factor, Q, which is typically used to differentiate such effects. Motivated in part by recent Monte-Carlo based simulations of this variability, we propose and demonstrate a stochastic dynamic model for Q based on the OrnsteinâUhlenbeck process. The proposed modelâs probability density function is a Gaussian in Q and with a linearly (in the logarithm of the \{LET\} variable) growing variance, but with rather complex scaling properties. The modelâs density function is shown to be quite sensitive to any functional parameterization of the mean (deterministic) behavior of the quality factor with a discontinuous first derivative in LET. The proposed linear stochastic model is also shown to be insensitive, however, to the precise functional form of the deterministic Q. },

  Abstract                 = {Dual beam radiation transmission systems are often used to non-invasively distinguish binary materials in security, industrial and medical applications. Material discrimination is based on detecting changes in hydrogen content and effective atomic number. We propose use of a dual beam technology in the reverse sense, as a sensitive directional sensor for fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field. The system uses retractable filter elements aligned with an organic scintillation detector and displays a distinctive digital-like response. Detected events are processed with a discriminator and basic counting system. We discuss the detection principle, the fast neutron detection threshold, the basic operational algorithm used and the response to different incident radiation energies. We propose work to extend the capabilities. This direction-sensitive detection concept may improve the sensitivity for detecting special nuclear materials such as in stacks of sea containers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract \{DEXA\} (dual-energy X-ray absorption) is widely used in airport scanners, industrial scanners and bone densitometers. \{DEXA\} determines the properties of materials by measuring the absorption differences of X-rays from a bremsstrahlung tube source with and without filtering. Filtering creates a beam with a higher mean energy, which causes lower material absorption. The absorption difference between measurements (those with a filter subtracted from those without a filter) is a positive number that increases with the effective atomic number of the material. In this paper, the concept of using a filter to create a dual beam and an absorption difference in materials is applied to radiation from a 252Cf source, called \{NEUDEG\} (neutron and dual-energy gamma absorption). \{NEUDEG\} includes absorptions for fast neutrons as well as the dual photon beams and thus an incentive for developing the method is that, unlike DEXA, it is inherently sensitive to the hydrogen content of materials. In this paper, a model for the absorption difference and absorption sum in \{NEUDEG\} is presented using the combined gamma ray and fast neutron mass attenuation coefficients. Absorption differences can be either positive or negative in NEUDEG, increasing with increases in the effective atomic number and decreasing with increases in the hydrogen content. Sample sets of absorption difference curves are calculated for materials with typical gamma-ray and fast neutron mass attenuation coefficients. The model, which uses tabulated mass attenuated coefficients, agrees with experimental data for porcelain tiles and polyethylene sheets. The effects of âbeam hardeningâ are also investigated. },

High spatial resolution dose profiles of microbeams are presented. Peak-to-valley dose ratios measured by \{FNTDs\} are consistent with published data. },

  Abstract                 = {Photon fluence spectra of the Seibersdorf Labor/BEV Picker 60Co therapy unit were calculated using two generally recognised Monte Carlo codes, PENELOPE-2006 and MCNP5. The complexity of the simulation model was increased in three steps (from a pure source capsule and a simplified model using rotational symmetry to a realistic model of the facility). Photon fluence spectra of both codes generally agree within their statistical standard uncertainties for the case of identical geometry set-up and particle transport parameter settings. Resulting total fluence values were about 0.3% higher for \{MCNP\} as compared to PENELOPE. The verification of the simulated photon fluence spectra was based upon depthâdose measurements in water performed with a \{PTW\} 31003 ionisation chamber and a thick-walled chamber type CC01. The depthâdose curve calculated with \{PENELOPE\} agreed with the curve obtained from measurements within 0.4% across the available depth region in the 30Â cmÂ ÃÂ 30Â cmÂ ÃÂ 30Â cm water phantom. The comparison of measured and simulated beam quality indices (TPR20,10) revealed deviations of less than 0.2%. },

The wax phantoms in the position of interest were scanned and introduced as lattice (voxel) geometry into the simulation input geometry. In this article the mathematical articulated hand model developed at \{KIT\} (Blunck etÂ al., 2009) is compared to these models. This mathematical hand phantom consists of rigid and flexible elements, allowing for an adaptable anatomy and flexible hand poses. In contrast to the static voxel models obtained by a complex procedure based on CT-scanned images, the articulated hand phantom can be used comparably simply for differing scenarios. },

  Abstract                 = {PADC-based nuclear track detectors have been widely used as convenient ambient dosemeters in many working places. However, due to the large energy dependence of their response in terms of ambient dose equivalent (Hâ(10)) and to the diversity of workplace fields in terms of energy distribution, the appropriate calibration of these dosemeters is a delicate task. These are among the reasons why \{ISO\} has introduced the 12789 Series of Standards, where the simulated workplace neutron fields are introduced and their use to calibrate neutron dosemeters is recommended. This approach was applied in the present work to the \{UAB\} PADC-based nuclear track detectors. As a suitable workplace, the treatment room of a 15Â MV Varian \{CLINAC\} \{DHX\} medical accelerator, located in the Ospedale S. Chiara (Pisa), was chosen. Here the neutron spectra in two points of tests (1.5Â m and 2Â m from the isocenter) were determined with the INFN-LNF Bonner Sphere Spectrometer equipped with Dysprosium activation foils (Dy-BSS), and the values of Hâ(10) were derived on this basis. The \{PADC\} dosemeters were exposed in these points. Their workplace specific H*(10) responses were determined and compared with those previously obtained in different simulated workplace or reference (ISO 8529) neutron fields. },

  Abstract                 = {The large angle dependence of the Hp(10) response in PADC-based personal neutron dosemeters constitutes a serious concern in operational radiation protection dosimetry. For planar dosemeters, the typical Hp(10) response falls by half or more when the incidence angle changes from 0Â° to 60Â°. To reduce this source of systematic uncertainty, configurations based on multiple detectors at different angles have been developed, but their complex geometries constitute an important obstacle to the implementation in routine services. This works proposes a simplified configuration, based on two orthogonal \{PADC\} detectors, which is suitable for the implementation in the routine service of INFN-LNF (Frascati). This system was tested, using a \{ISO\} slab standard phantom, in the following reference neutron fields: 241AmâBe and 252Cf(D2O) available at ENEA-Bologna, and 1.2Â MeV, 5Â MeV and 14.8Â MeV mono-chromatic beams available at \{PTB\} Braunschweig. Incidence angles of 0Â°, Â±15Â°, Â±30Â°, Â±45Â° and Â±60Â° were chosen. The sum of the track density in the \{PADC\} parallel to the phantom and that in the detector normal to the phantom face, was regarded as âdosemeter readingâ. On this basis the Hp(10) response was calculated for different energies and incidence angles. As expected, the angular response of the two-orthogonal-element dosemeter is highly improved with respect to that of a single planar PADC. },

In this work a newly developed passive Bonner Sphere Spectrometer, using Dysprosium activation foils as central detectors (Dy-BSS), was tested through comparison with a well-established active BSS. As a suitable neutron field, where both systems can correctly operate, the 2.5Â MeV quasi mono-energetic beam of the \{ENEA\} Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG) was chosen. The two spectrometers are based on substantially different operation principles, therefore their response matrix are very different. In addition, the \{BSS\} are independently calibrated in different reference neutron fields. The exercise took place at 90Â° and at a fixed distance from the neutron emitting deuterated target. As reference data, the results obtained by unfolding the active \{BSS\} data were used. The \{FRUIT\} unfolding code, ver. 5 was used. The results of the Dy-BSS are fully comparable with those of the active BSS, in terms of both total fluence and shape of the neutron spectra. For the energy range studied in this exercise, the expected level of accuracy of the Dy-BSS and its suitability for operational neutron monitoring are fully confirmed. },

  Abstract                 = {Organic scintillators with long luminescent lifetimes can theoretically be used to temporally filter out radiation-induced luminescence and Cerenkov light (the so-called stem signal) when used as fibre-coupled radiotherapy dosimeters. Since the medical linear accelerators (linacs11Abbreviations: medical linear accelerator (linac); 2,5âDiphenyloxazole (PPO); maximum emission wavelength (Î»max); photomultiplier tube (PMT). ) used for radiotherapy treatments deliver pulsed beams, the stem signal can be suppressed using dosimeter materials with luminescent lifetimes much longer than that of the stem signal. However, producing organic scintillators with long luminescent lifetimes has proven difficult in practice. We report on the results of experiments performed using two organic scintillators, one commercially available and one custom made. The luminescent lifetimes of the scintillators have been measured using i) optical excitation by pulsed \{UV\} light, and ii) irradiative excitation using high-energy X-rays from a linac. A luminescent lifetime component on the order of 20Â Î¼s was estimated for the custom-made organic scintillator, while the commercial scintillator exhibited a fast component of approximately 5Â ns lifetime (7Â ns as stated by the manufacturer) and an approximate 10Â Î¼s lifetime slow component. Although these lifetimes are not long enough for practical applications in radiotherapy dosimetry, this study supports that the stem signal can be greatly reduced by applying a temporal gating. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation accidents with exposure of human beings can assume huge dimensions concerning occurring health impairments and essential medical resources such as personnel, patient care management and appropriate medical facilities. Particularly in mass-casualty events, a rapid sorting and allocation of victims to treatment is needed and their classification in medical treatment groups has to be conducted as fast as possible. For triage purposes several approaches can be considered. Clinical signs and symptoms are extremely helpful in estimating radiation effects on an organ-based level, whereas the assessment of radiation effects based on cytogenetic biodosimetry tools is the alternative approach. For both systems there are pros and cons with respect to the usefulness for specific applications, such as individual cases versus mass-casualty screening or whole- versus partial-body exposures. Among the biodosimetry tools the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) is considered as the âgold standardâ for biodosimetry after an acute radiation exposure. Recently, steady progress in standardization and harmonization of the \{DCA\} has occurred, in order to enable the validated performance of the \{DCA\} in the frame of cooperative response of biodosimetry networks during a large scale radiological scenario. Using the \{DCA\} in triage mode which allows the stratification of radiation exposed victims into broad 1.0Â Gy categories only 20â50 metaphase cells per subject are scored instead of the 500â1000 scored for routine analysis. Our data show that there are significant differences between the dicentric yields after 1.0Â Gy and 3.0Â Gy Î³-ray exÂ vivo exposure of blood suggesting this assay as suitable for the distinction between high and low dosed exposed individuals. These preliminary findings indicate the usefulness of the \{DCA\} also for therapeutic decision making. },

The clonogenic assay was used to measure the survival cell fraction. As expected, the results revealed an increase of cellular damage with increased doses made evident from the increased number of micronuclei (MN) per binucleated cell (BN). Besides this study involving the biological effects induced by direct irradiation, and due to the fact that radiation-induced genomic instability is thought to be an early event in radiation carcinogenesis, we analyzed the genomic instability in early and delayed untargeted effects, by using the medium transfer technique. The obtained results show that unirradiated cells exposed to irradiated medium reveal a higher cellular damage in earlier effects when compared to the delayed effects. The obtained results may provide clues for the biodosimetric determination of radon dose to airway cells at cumulative exposures. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Commissioning and quality assurance of radiotherapy linear accelerators require measurement of the absorbed dose to water, and a wide range of detectors are available for absolute and relative dosimetry in megavoltage beams. In this paper, the \{PTW\} microLion isooctane-filled ionization chamber has been tested to perform relative measurements in a 6Â MV photon beam from a linear accelerator. Output factors, percent depth dose and dose profiles have been obtained for small and large fields. These quantities have been compared with those from usual detectors in the routine practice. In order to carry out a more realistic comparison, an uncertainty analysis has been developed, taking type A and B uncertainties into account. The results present microLion as a good option when high spatial resolution is needed, thanks to its reduced sensitive volume. The liquid filling also provides a high signal compared to other detectors, like that based on air filling. Furthermore, the relative response of microLion when field size is varied suggests that this detector has energy dependence, since it is appreciated an over-response for small fields and an under-response for the large ones. This effect is more obvious for field sizes wider than 20Â ÃÂ 20Â cm2, where the differences in percent depth dose at great depths exceed the uncertainties estimated in this study. },

All experiments described in this study were conducted using a sealed commercially available \{OSL\} dosimeter. Our experiments showed that the element holder showed significant light leaks that result in light-induced fading. While an opaque dosimeter holder may reduce the effect, a reengineered element holder is needed. The trend in lighting fading was also clearly demonstrated using fluorescent and incandescent lighting conditions. A repeated reading of a dosimeter causes a predictable loss in signal that must be taken into account for each subsequent reading. Our study concludes that the likelihood that dose data may be loss as a result of light induced fading is a real possibility with the advent of the identified light leaks. },

The empirical Predictive Code for Aircrew radiation exposure (PCAire) along with corresponding in-flight measurements were used to estimate their exposures from flight data and crew rosters continually provided by Air Canada. Almost all of the pilots studied received more than the annual general public limit of 1Â mSv, with the majority receiving around 3Â mSv and none exceeded the recommended intervention level of 6Â mSv. The highest route exposures were found to be on flights from Canada to Asia, Europe and the Southern hemisphere. The routes with the highest dose rates were to Europe and the long haul flights over Canada and the northern USA, a result of the distortion of the vertical cutoff rigidity from the magnetic North Pole's location in Canada. Although altitude, geomagnetic latitude and flight time are contributing factors to the exposures to the pilots on each route, Canada's unique geomagnetic location indicated a need to assess Canadian aircrew over their careers. },

In accelerator irradiations, targets of varying composition, including a number of elemental targets of high Z, were exposed in contact with layers of CR-39 \{PNTD\} to beams of 60Â MeV, 230Â MeV, and 1Â GeV protons at doses of 10â50Â Gy. Chemical etching of CR-39 under standard conditions (50Â Â°C, 6.25Â N NaOH) for 2â4Â h (removed layer BÂ =Â 0.5â1.0Â Î¼m) yielded secondary track densities of 105â106Â cmâ2 observable under a standard optical microscope with 500Ãâ800Ã magnification. Ordinarily such a short duration etch would not be expected to enlarge the tracks sufficiently for them to be resolved by visible light optics. However, due to the short-range of the particles, a longer chemical processing would have over-etched the tracks until they were no longer recognizable. The tracks we observe in CR-39 \{PNTD\} irradiated in these experiments are the result of residual heavy recoil fragments returning to equilibrium via evaporation processes following proton-induced knock out of light particles via preequilibrium processes. Because the heavy recoil particles are very near the end of their ranges (i.e. in the Bragg peak), their \{LET\} is extremely high and changes rapidly. Consequently, the tracks they produce in CR-39 \{PNTD\} often take the form of long tubes rather than the conical etch pits produced by higher energy particles. },

However, for dating unheated feldspar-bearing sediments older than 100â200 ka, \{MA\} \{TL\} can still be useful. To improve precision in burial-dose estimation from TL, a post-bleaching regenerative-dose procedure is beneficial. However, the long-known regenerative-dose \{TL\} sensitivity changes cause significant age under-estimation in such \{MA\} TL. Here a practical procedure is demonstrated to correct for this post-bleaching sensitivity change. Two samples of fine grain, polymineral loess having independent ages of â¼130 ka and â¼350 ka are employed with the use of the \{SLIDE\} (combined additive-dose and regenerative-dose responses) procedure to show that not only accuracy but improved precision can be attained with use of this practical procedure. The procedure employs an operational definition of laboratory-dose sensitivity change with respect to a second-glow \{TL\} signal, and corrects for the sensitivity change as a function of laboratory dose and of glowcurve temperature. },

  Abstract                 = {Present work highlights liquid scintillation inclusion techniques as a tool for simultaneous determination of gross Î± and Î² activities in composite samples. This preliminary study comprises a preamble exercise to check whether Automatic Efficiency Control (AEC) and knee point inclusion techniques which are conventionally used for analysis of two Î²-emitting radio-nuclides in a mixture, can be implemented for quantification of gross Î± and Î² activities in composite samples. In inclusion techniques, two counting regions are set such that there are spill-up and spill-down of pulse events in each region from both types of radio-nuclides. \{AEC\} which is built-in feature in Packard Tri-Carb 2900Â TR Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) provides automatic counting region adjustments for single and dual label samples according to the degree of quench present in sample. While knee point inclusion technique requires manual Lower Level (LL) and Upper Level (UL) discriminator setting to define two counting regions. In the present study, Î±/Î² spiked composite samples were treated as dual label samples with Î± and Î² radio-nuclides as two distinct entities contributing to the gross activities and analyzed employing \{AEC\} and knee point inclusion techniques. Instrument discriminator settings and regions of interest (ROI) were evaluated to determine optimum counting conditions for both the techniques. Three sets of pure alpha and pure beta standards simulating the activity concentrations of real samples in terms of Î±/Î² activity ratios were used to calibrate LSC. Calibration methodology for Packard Tri-Carb 2900Â TR \{LSC\} with respect to the above measurements using 241Am, 36Cl and 90Sr/90Y calibration standards is explained in detail. The practicability and working performance of these techniques was checked by the validation trials with spiked synthetic samples covering range of Î±/Î² activity ratios from 1:1 to 1:50 and 50:1. Procedures have been tested by comparison with, established \{PSA\} technique and repeatability has been evaluated. },

The luminescence lifetime has been measured as 40 and 628Â Î¼s of fast and slow components respectively. The \{TL\} parameters such as trap depth (E), frequency factor (s) and the order of kinetics (b) are determined. The phosphor is found to be 6 and 4 times more sensitive than CaSO4:Dy and Î±-Al2O3:C, respectively, in \{TL\} mode. However, its \{OSL\} sensitivity is 75% of Î±-Al2O3:C. It is found to possess three \{OSL\} components having photoionization cross-sections of 1.4Â ÃÂ 10â17, 1.2Â ÃÂ 10â18 and 5.2Â ÃÂ 10â19Â cm2 respectively. The temperature dependence of \{OSL\} studies showed that integrated TA-OSL signal increases with stimulation temperature between 50 and 250Â Â°C, while between 260 and 450Â Â°C the signal intensity decreases. This behavior is interpreted to arise from competing effects of thermal assistance (activation energy EAÂ =Â 0.063Â Â±Â 0.0012Â eV) and depletion of trapped charges. This increase of \{OSL\} at elevated temperature can be employed for enhancing the sensitivity of phosphor for radiation dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of pure analytical sodium chloride (NaCl) was studied. Performing series of CW-OSL (continuous wave OSL) readouts it was found that subsequent CW-OSL decay, after some delay, starts from significantly higher intensity level than the final intensity of the previous readout. To study this âregeneration effectâ a new type of measurements was implemented â the variable delay \{OSL\} (VD-OSL) method. The idea of VD-OSL is explained â it allows to study \{OSL\} kinetics at very long time scale. VD-OSL data confirm coexistence of two effects in NaCl â regeneration and fading of the \{OSL\} signal. After partial CW-OSL readout, regeneration predominates in the short time scale of the order of 103Â s. Then, fading becomes dominant. The same measurements were applied to commonly used Al2O3:C material as well. Nevertheless, the results do not show such behavior at the studied time scale. Theoretical arguments are presented that the regeneration mechanism cannot be explained on the basis of the simple trap model. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Due to well defined three dimensional nano- and micro-porous structure, one of the most important properties of zeolite is its surface adsorption capacity. Nevertheless, a natural zeolite adsorption capability of 222Rn has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this paper is to review the research concerning the application of natural zeolite in 222Rn adsorption. To achieve this goal the investigation based on measurements of radon adsorption by various zeolite granulation was done. Ball mill is used to achieve different granulations of zeolite in the range of Î¼mâmm, whereas the particle size distributions are determined by particle size analyzer, Mastersizer 2000. The zeolite samples were exposed to elevated radon concentrations up to 1800Â Bq/m3 inside a closed chamber (volumeÂ âÂ 5.4Â ÃÂ 10â3Â m3). The absorbed radon quantity was measured by high resolution gamma spectroscopy. The influence of particle size was measured and discussed. We found that the adsorption coefficients that were obtained in our experiment for natural zeolite samples for different granulations are similar to adsorbing coefficients for silica gel, but they are an order of magnitude lower than radon adsorbing coefficient for synthetic zeolite. The adsorption coefficient for activated charcoal derived in our experiment (â3Â m3/kg) is in average 50 times higher comparing to the adsorption coefficients obtained for zeolite samples (0.038Â m3/kgâ0.11Â m3/kg). All adsorbing coefficients are determined for very low relative humidity of air of about 7%, since our simple experimental setup did not allow possibility to change the relative humidity, or temperature. In addition, we explored the perturbation of radon concentration inside small-volume radon chamber caused by the presence of adsorbing sample and influence of this perturbation on obtained values of adsorbing coefficients. },

  Abstract                 = {Thermoluminescent (TL) detectors are often used for measurements of radiation doses in space. While space radiation is composed of a mixture of heavy charged particles, the relative \{TL\} efficiency depends on ionization density. The question therefore arises: what is the relative efficiency of \{TLDs\} to the radiation present in space? In the attempt to answer this question, the relative \{TL\} efficiency of two types of lithium fluoride detectors for space radiation has been calculated, based on the theoretical space spectra and the experimental values of \{TL\} efficiency to ion beams. The \{TL\} efficiency of LiF:Mg,Ti detectors for radiation encountered at typical low-Earthâs orbit was found to be close to unity, justifying a common application of these \{TLDs\} to space dosimetry. The \{TL\} efficiency of LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors is significantly lower. It was found that a shielding may have a significant influence on the relative response of TLDs, due to changes caused in the radiation spectrum. In case of application of \{TLDs\} outside the Earthâs magnetosphere, one should expect lower relative efficiency than at the low-Earthâs orbit. },

  Abstract                 = {\{HAMLET\} is an European Commission research project aiming at optimal scientific exploitation of the data produced within the space experiment MATROSHKA. During phase 1 of this experiment a human phantom equipped with several thousands of radiation detectors (mainly TLDs) was exposed outside the International Space Station for 1.5 years. Besides the measurements realized in Earth orbit, the \{HAMLET\} project includes also a ground-based program of intercomparison of detector response to high-energy ion beams. Within the paper, the relative response of main glow-curve peaks of various \{TLDs\} (mostly based on LiF) used in frame of the \{MATROSHKA\} experiment by three laboratories (DLR Cologne, \{ATI\} Vienna and \{IFJ\} Krakow) for radiation in space and several ion beams, has been compared. For LiF:Mg,Ti detectors a very good agreement between results obtained by the three laboratories was observed, both for space and accelerator-based exposures. This should be considered a remarkable result, taking into account that the studied \{TLDs\} originated from six different batches, manufactured by two producers exploiting different production techniques and were processed by three laboratories, using significantly different protocols (annealing, readout, calibration, glow-curve analysis). Another type of \{TL\} detectors, LiF:Mg,Cu,P, was found to show response to cosmic radiation lower than that of LiF:Mg,Ti by 5%â18%. },

The \{TLDs\} were irradiated with two radiation modalities (gamma rays and thermal neutrons) and were stored at two temperatures (â17.4Â Â°C andÂ +18.5Â Â°C). The goal of the experiment was to verify the stability of \{TLDs\} in the context of their application in long-term measurements in space. The results revealed that the response of all \{TLDs\} is stable within 10% for the studied temperature range. No influence of the radiation type was found.

One of the tasks of the \{EU\} \{FP7\} \{ORAMED\} project was to develop the first dosemeter specially dedicated to measurements of HP(3). This goal was achieved by designing and testing of the EYE-Dâ¢ dosemeter. This dosemeter, comprising an MCP-N (LiF:Mg,Cu,P) thermoluminescent detector and an optimized polyamide capsule, was developed by the \{RADCARD\} company. The dosemeter is designed for an indefinite use and enables cold sterilization. The test measurements and Monte Carlo calculations of the photon energy response and angular response produced very satisfactory results: all obtained values are within about 20% around unity (with respect to Cs-137). The dosemeter fulfills all requirements for its application in dosimetry in interventional radiology. },

The instruments were tested for the readouts of highly irradiated LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP) \{TL\} detectors, which require readout up to 550Â Â°C, in case of doses exceeding 1Â kGy. It was found that the Harshaw 3500 can be used, without any additional light attenuation, for the measurements of \{MCP\} detectors exposed to doses up to about 5Â Gy. For the other two readers the upper dose limit is about 10 times lower. It was also found that the Harshaw 3500 shows the best thermal stability considering the peak maximum position. For the ultra-high doses the differences in the spectral characteristics of the applied optical filters and photomultipliers, in conjunction with an evolution of the \{MCP\} \{TL\} emission spectrum with increasing dose, significantly influence the shape of \{TL\} glow curves measured with the DA-20 reader.

The present work is aimed to examine the effect of blue (470Â nm) illumination on \{TL\} emission from main dosimetric trap (MDT) in both blue (384â445Â nm) and \{UV\} (340â372Â nm) spectral windows. On optical bleaching with blue light the \{TL\} peak temperature (Tm) is shifted to higher temperature side and full width at half maximum (FWHM) also increases, implying the \{MDT\} is not a single trap, rather it is composed of several discrete traps or distribution of traps. This accords with earlier published works. The Tm â Tstop method, and distribution of activation energies, measured using initial rise method suggest that the \{MDT\} is composed of distribution of traps or close overlapping of discrete traps. The low temperature part of the \{TL\} glow peak bleaches faster than the high temperature part of the \{TL\} peak, suggesting that the traps responsible for the low temperature part of the \{TL\} glow curve have higher photo-ionization cross-section for OSL. Both illumination and phototransferred \{TL\} (PTTL) experiments suggest a distribution of traps and increase of \{FWHM\} with Tm. Partial annealing experiments on continuous wave \{OSL\} (CW-OSL) signal suggests that the traps responsible for the lower temperature part of the \{TL\} peak are responsible for the fast component (higher photo-ionization cross-section). Quantitative analysis of components with different photo-ionization cross-section of the partially annealed \{OSL\} decay curves suggest that 220Â Â°C preheating reduces the faster component by 100%, medium component by 60%, and the slower component remains practically unaffected. Similar behaviours are observed in both the emission windows. },

Doses and dose uniformity were measured using alanine â electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and ionization chambers. Dosimetry mapping results showed â¼2 and â¼12% non-uniformity in the radiation fields for the two smaller (1/3, 2/3) and one larger (3/3) fields, respectively. Hematology results showed no marked differences in neutrophil and platelet counts 1 and 2 days (d) after irradiation. The lymphocyte counts, as expected, demonstrate a progressive decline below baseline levels 1 and 2Â d after irradiation with increasing fraction of the body exposed, while the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios show the inverse effect, with a progressive increase with the fraction of body exposed. The bone marrow biomarker, Flt3 ligand, demonstrated a progressive increase in values with increasing fraction of the body exposed; the 2Â d response was enhanced compared to 1Â d. The radioresponse 1Â d after irradiation for the acute phase reactant protein biomarker, serum amyloid A (SAA) that is synthesized by the liver, was significantly influenced depending on whether the mouse head was in the radiation field. Use of multiple biomarkers based on hematology and proteomic targets provide an enhancement in early-phase partial-body radiation exposure assessment. },

The authors show that the count numbers recorded with the use of photomultiplier tubes are well described by negative binomial distributions, different ones for background counts and photon induced counts. This fact is then exploited in pseudo-random count number generation and simulations of De determination assuming a saturating exponential growth. A least squares fitting procedure is applied using different types of weights to determine whether the obtained De's and their error estimates are unbiased and accurate. A weighting procedure is suggested that leads to almost unbiased De estimates. It is also shown that the assumption of Poisson distribution in De estimation may lead to severe underestimation of the De error. },

  Abstract                 = {Pooled analyses of epidemiological case--control studies on lung cancer and residential radon have shown that radon exposure in dwellings increases lung cancer risk, and that the increase is statistically significant also for prolonged exposures to low-medium level of radon concentration, i.e. levels commonly found in many dwellings. In this paper, a simple method to evaluate the health burden due to the presence of radon in homes (i.e. the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon exposure in dwellings) was presented. This method is based on the following parameters: i) the excess relative risk per unit of exposure evaluated in case-control studies; ii) the average radon concentration that can be considered representative of population exposure in dwellings; iii) the total number of lung cancer deaths occurring each year. Moreover, the interaction between radon and cigarette smoking is needed to be taken into account: in fact, although most of the persons are non-smokers, most of the lung cancer deaths attributed to radon are actually due to the multiplicative effect of radon and cigarette smoking. To show this effect, the number of radon related lung cancer deaths estimated to occur among current, former and never smokers was calculated separately for males and females, taking into account the relative risk of lung cancer for the different smoking categories and the prevalence of smoking habits. The methodology described in this work was applied to all the 21 Italian Regions in order to illustrate it. The overall fraction of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon in Italy is about 10%, with values in individual Regions ranging from 4% to 16%. The greater part of the lung cancers attributable to radon is estimated to occur among current smokers for both males and females (72% and 60%, respectively, at national level). This is due to the synergistic effects of radon and cigarette smoking, which should therefore be taken into account in policies aimed to reduce the health burden from radon. },

  Abstract                 = {In the case of a large-scale nuclear or radiological incidents a reliable estimate of dose is an essential tool for providing timely assessment of radiation exposure and for making life-saving medical decisions. Cytogenetics is considered as the âgold standardâ for biodosimetry. The dicentric analysis (DA) represents the most specific cytogenetic bioassay. The micronucleus test (MN) applied in interphase in peripheral lymphocytes is an alternative and simpler approach. A dose-effect calibration curve for the \{MN\} frequency in peripheral lymphocytes from 27 adult donors was established after in vitro irradiation at a dose range 0.15â8Â Gy of 137Cs gamma rays (dose rate 6Â Gy minâ1). Dose prediction by visual scoring in a dose-blinded study (0.15â4.0Â Gy) revealed a high level of accuracy (RÂ =Â 0.89). The scoring of \{MN\} is time consuming and requires adequate skills and expertise. Automated image analysis is a feasible approach allowing to reduce the time and to increase the accuracy of the dose estimation decreasing the variability due to subjective evaluation. A good correlation (RÂ =Â 0.705) between visual and automated scoring with visual correction was observed over the dose range 0â2Â Gy. Almost perfect discrimination power for exposure to 1â2Â Gy, and a satisfactory power for 0.6Â Gy were detected. This threshold level can be considered sufficient for identification of sub lethally exposed individuals by automated \{CBMN\} assay. },

Non-expensive alpha counting following some analytical steps for extracting and depositing 210Po were used for providing the 210Pb data. In the analyzed samples, 210Pb values of increasingly older samples fitted an exponential curve, thus suggesting that the production of 210Pb has been constant with time.

The soda straw growth rates were determined from the best fit to the exponential curve through the 210Pb activity concentration. The results of the measurements allowed estimate a longitudinal rate corresponding to 1.3Â mm/yr and a lateral rate of 0.01Â mm/yr, which permitted calculate times of 70 years and 317â498 years for their formation, respectively.

Dosimeters were calibrated in a reference clinical linear acccelerator beam in a water tank at a reference facility at the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (CEA LIST/LNE LNHB, Saclay. Radiation qualities of 6, 12 and 20Â MV were used with standard calibration conditions described in \{IAEA\} \{TRS\} 398 and non-standard conditions. Profile and depth dose ion chamber measurements were also made to provide reference values. Measurements were made in a water tank into which pipes could be inserted which held dosimeters in pre-determined and reproducible positions. The water tank was built to enable investigation of doses up to 60Â cm from the beam axis. A first set of experiments was carried out with the beam passing through the tank. From this first experiment, penumbra and out-of-field dose profiles including water and collimator scatter and leakage were found over three orders of magnitude. Two further sets of experiments using the same experimental arrangement with the beam outside the tank, to avoid water scatter, were designed to measure collimator scatter and leakage by closing the jaws of the collimator. Depending on the energy, typical leakage and collimator scatter represents 10â40% and 30â50% of the total out-of-field doses respectively. It was concluded that all dosimeters can be used for out-of-field photon dosimetry. All show good uniformity, good reproducibility, and can be used down to low doses expected at distances remote from the subsequent radiotherapy target volume. },

Conversion coefficients from air kerma to dose equivalent at 3Â mm depth for \{RQR\} and \{ISO\} radiation qualities, employed for type test and calibration purposes, have been calculated in a new phantom introduced within the \{ORAMED\} (Optimization of \{RAdiation\} protection for \{MEDical\} staff) project. This phantom is more representative of the head so that the estimation of Hlens by Hp(3) is more accurate. },

  Abstract                 = {The Energy plus Transmutation (EPT) set-up of the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia is composed of a lead spallation target surrounded by a blanket of natural uranium. The target was irradiated with 4Â GeV deuterons. Rates of reactions leading to the production of 206Bi from 209Bi were determined through gamma spectrometry. These were compared with calculated reaction rates determined using the \{MCNPX\} code, including the \{INCL4\} intranuclear cascade and \{ABLA\} fission/evaporation models along with available cross section data. Close agreement was found for the production of 206Bi. The high threshold energy of neutron induced production indicates that neutrons causing these reactions are most likely to originate in the intranuclear cascade phase of the interaction. This is therefore an important reaction for validation of the computational models used. },

  Abstract                 = {The use of silicates as thermoluminescent material is well known and ranges from the identification of irradiated food to the dose reconstruction using quartz extracted from bricks and tiles. Recently the possibility to collect silicates from the dust present on personal objects for individual dosimetry in case of radiation accident or radiological attack, was investigated for dose of 10Â Gy. The aim of the present work was to investigate the possibility to detect dose levels below 10Â Gy. To this extent objects supposed to contain high amount of silicates such as keys, coins and cigarette tobacco (Bortolin etÂ al., 2010) were tested in the dose range 0.1â5.0Â Gy. The \{TL\} signal was distinguishable from the geological signal in the whole range of dose. To simulate a realistic situation, laboratory irradiation was performed directly on the objects before silicates collection and \{TL\} analysis were carried out at two different time points, within a week. The glow curves registered 7 days after laboratory irradiation at 5Â Gy showed an artificially radiation-induced \{TL\} signal well distinguishable from the natural background. },

The nature of the trapping centres agrees with that predicted by the energy level scheme. The hole accepting dopants (Ce3+ and Tb3+) act as recombination centres emitting the characteristic Ce3+ or Tb3+ emission. The electron accepting codopants produce glow peaks at different temperatures. The sequence of glow peaks maxima of the electron accepting codopants appears exactly as predicted by the level scheme of the divalent Ln ions. Trap depths, determined with the various heating rate method, follow the trend as predicted by the level scheme but were found systematically shallower. This can be explained by the uncertainty in the energy level predictions and/or tunnelling of the charge carriers from codopant to dopant and the presence of excited states of the divalent Ln ions in the band gap which makes alternative recombination pathways possible. In general it can be concluded that the energy level scheme is a powerful tool to interpret and predict all kinds of \{TL\} phenomena. },

  Abstract                 = {The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal of natural quartz measured under constant stimulation power (CW-OSL) is a featureless decay curve where underlying components cannot be identified easily. Visual interpretation of quartz \{OSL\} signals is easier if signals are shown in spectrum-like form. This can be achieved either through ramped stimulation, or by transforming a measured CW-OSL curve into a pseudo \{OSL\} curve. We show that both give similar results, but that transformation should be preferred as CW-OSL provides best signal-to-noise ratios. We present different transformation methods to obtain pseudo \{OSL\} curves and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. In addition, we show that different pseudo \{OSL\} transformations can be used to emphasize specific aspects of the \{OSL\} signal. We conclude that transformation of CW-OSL to pseudo hyperbolically modulated \{OSL\} provides the most useful visualization of the quartz fast \{OSL\} component. Pseudo parabolic modulated \{OSL\} is the transformation of choice for showing the slow component(s). The pseudo \{OSL\} curves can be used for rapid visual inspection of the relative contribution of the \{OSL\} components prior to further analysis. },

  Abstract                 = {The use of computed tomography (CT) worldwide is continuing to increase for both adults and children, posing population health risks due to radiation exposure. These risks are highest for children, reducing with age at exposure. Effective dose is a useful parameter for expressing relative risk and comparing dose. In this study, high sensitivity thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLD) were used to measure organ absorbed doses and to calculate effective dose for paediatric \{CT\} examinations of the brain, chest and abdomen/pelvis. Formalisms recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) in Publications 60 and 103 were assessed. The effective dose computed using \{ICRP\} 103 was 22% lower for a \{CT\} brain examination, 16% higher for a \{CT\} chest examination and 4% lower for a \{CT\} abdomen/pelvis examination when compared with the effective dose computed using \{ICRP\} 60. These values were compared with effective dose calculated using a dose length product (DLP) conversion method. The \{DLP\} derived effective doses were within 30% of the \{TLD\} derived effective doses. In summary, the effective dose varies depending on the \{ICRP\} definition used, predominantly due to changes in tissue weighting factors. Furthermore, the \{DLP\} conversion method is relatively reliable for approximating effective dose and easy to use. },

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of radioactive in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in surficial material exposed to cosmic rays allow either determining the long-term denudation rate assuming that the surface studied has reached steady-state (where production and losses by denudation and radioactive decay are in equilibrium) (infinite exposure time), or dating the initiation of exposure to cosmic rays, assuming that the denudation and post-depositional processes are negligible. Criteria for determining whether a surface is eroding or undergoing burial as well as quantitative information on denudation or burial rates may be obtained from cosmogenic nuclide depth profiles. With the refinement of the physical parameters involved in the production of in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides, a unique well-constrained depth profile now permits determination of both the exposure time and the denudation rate affecting a surface. In this paper, we first mathematically demonstrate that the exponential decrease of the in situ-produced 10Be concentrations observed along a depth profile constrains a unique exposure time and denudation rate when considering both neutrons and muons. In the second part, an improved chi-square inversion model is described and tested in the third part with actual measured profiles. },

The electron beam irradiations were performed using a 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 field size, 100Â cm source-phantom surface distance and the dosimeters were positioned at the depth of maximum dose (1.2Â cm). The \{TL\} readings were carried out between 24 and 32Â h after irradiation using a Harshaw 3500Â TL reader. The \{TL\} doseâresponse of both type of dosimeters and phantoms presented linear behavior on the electron dose range from 0.1 to 5Â Gy CaSO4:Dy dosimeter is 21 times more sensitive than LiF:Mg,Ti, dosimeter commonly used in clinical dosimetry.

Undoped monocrystalline ZnSe has an extremely low leakage current over a wide range of temperatures up to 167Â Â°C and can be used as a radiometric X-ray detector in pulse-counting mode over a wide temperature range up to at least 130Â Â°C. },

  Abstract                 = {The research presented in this paper demonstrates the feasibility and the advantages of using spherical micro diodes for radiation dosimetry. The spherical symmetry of the diode response is demonstrated, compared to that of planar diodes. The application of the spherical diode described here is for radiotherapy dosimetry, particularly brachytherapy. Measurements were done in \{PMMA\} phantoms. The advantage of the spherical diode is that it can be used for radiation measurement in a 4Ï geometry, it was demonstrated by measurements in both axial and azimuthal planes. The diodes were found to respond equally to radiation coming from all directions, directly from the source or due to scattered radiation within the medium. In the present work 1.8Â mm diameter silicone diodes were used. The small size of these spherical diodes provides local dose measurement and can be used for in situ dosimetry while treatment takes place. Treatment planning correction can be made accordingly. Commercially available seeds of the isotopes \{I125\} and Pd103 were used as radiation sources. The spherical diodes response was compared with that of planar diodes \{XRB\} generally used for \{UV\} and X-ray dosimetry, and with \{TLD\} measurements. We have also compared the measured results with Monte Carlo simulation, applying the \{MCNP\} code and with calculations shown in the TG-43 report. },

  Abstract                 = {The thermoluminescent (TLD) method is one of the most commonly used in dose measurements in radiation protection dosimetry. Due to its many advantages this method is widely spread. However, \{TLD\} has especially one disadvantage which is very inconvenient: the dose information in already read detectors is erased and in routine standard way the dose can not be reassessed. The positive is that this shortcoming can be eliminated by applying \{UV\} radiation. After first readout the same detector can be subjected to \{UV\} exposure and then read once again to reassess the dose. This method for reassessment of dose is based on phototransferred thermoluminescence (PTTL). In an irradiated \{TL\} detector deep traps are not emptied during the first readout. During exposure to UV, electrons are transferred from deep traps to shallower dosimetric traps. This \{TL\} signal emerging during the second readout following \{UV\} illumination is called phototransferred thermoluminescence. A method for reassessment of dose in a previously readout \{TLD\} is presented in this work. Experiments show that the method works well within region of doses between 5 and 50Â mGy, but could be applied for higher doses as well. The efficiency of dose reassessment reaches about 17 percent of the first readout. The method could be a noticeable improvement in \{TLD\} dosimetry, giving more opportunities for better control and reliability of measurements. },

The behaviour of these signal components, was examined under various sample treatments and experimental conditions. Preheating experiments showed that the \{OSL\} signal is stable up to temperatures â¼250Â Â°C then becomes unstable. The dose response of the TR-OSL signal from zircon was determined in the range from 1Â Gy to 1Â kGy and observed to be increasing linearly. Practically, no effect of radiation dose on the lifetimes of signal components was observed. In addition, the effect of measurement temperature on the TR-OSL decay lifetimes was also investigated. Thermal quenching energies of the âfastâ and the âslowâ components were found to be very close to each other i.e. 0.18 and 0.24Â eV respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Time-Resolved Optically Stimulated Luminescence (TR-OSL) from BeO ceramics was investigated using a blue laser (445Â nm) as stimulation light source. It was observed that, at relatively low dose levels (up to â¼25Â Gy) the TR-OSL decay curve can be approximated with a single exponential decay function with a lifetime of â¼26Â Î¼s at room temperature. Beyond 25Â Gy a new decay component with a lifetime of a â¼2Â Î¼s was observed in addition to the â¼26Â Î¼s component. Thermal stability, radiation dose response, optical bleaching, measurement temperature dependence of the components of the TR-OSL signal were investigated in detail. As result of these studies, a new \{OSL\} component which becomes unstable after 150Â Â°C was observed. \{OSL\} decay rate of this component was found to be higher than the one which becomes unstable after 300Â Â°C. In order to obtain information about the temperature dependence of the luminescence efficiency, luminescence emission lifetime was determined in the temperature range from 30 to 130Â Â°C with 10Â Â°C steps. Using the temperature dependence of the lifetime, thermal quenching energy was determined to be around 0.56Â eV for the 26Â Î¼s component. For the â¼2Â Î¼s component an enhancement in the component intensity was observed pointing to a thermally assisted process with activation energy of 0.15Â eV. },

  Abstract                 = {This study explores the potential for using photon-stimulated luminescence of quartz grains to retrospectively evaluate multi-kGy gamma radiation doses. Subsamples from two ceramic tiles were given 60Co gamma doses of 1, 3, 5, 15 and 30Â kGy (nominal), accompanied by \{PMMA\} dosimeters and quartz grains from a geological sample known to exhibit thermally-transferred optically-stimulated luminescence (TTOSL). Following gamma irradiation, quartz grains were prepared from each subsample. \{OSL\} and \{TTOSL\} signals were measured for different preheat temperatures, and following re-irradiation with beta doses designed to equal the nominal gamma doses. \{OSL\} responses to 10Â Gy beta test doses were measured following each cycle of high dose irradiation. Gamma doses were predicted from the beta responses, to evaluate the effectiveness of retrospective dose evaluation for different signal integrals, preheat combinations, and dose intervals. The use of linear modulation limited maximum \{OSL\} signal levels to 1.5Â ÃÂ 106 cps without reducing detector sensitivity, for the measurement of smaller \{TTOSL\} signals. The dosimetric behaviour of the three samples differed significantly: the best results were obtained from the pre-prepared geological quartz. \{OSL\} signals evident at short stimulation times, which are conventionally used for dosimetry and dating, did not in general appear appropriate for dosimetry in the range of doses examined. They exhibited dose response characteristics that were highly preheat dependant and variable in form between samples, which contained rapidly saturating and/or non-monotonic components. Higher preheats, up to 300Â Â°C, preferentially removed \{OSL\} and \{TTOSL\} signals evident at longer stimulation times: those that remained yielded growth in signal with dose to approximately 10Â kGy, but the accuracy of retrospective dose determinations was variable. \{TTOSL\} signals evident at short stimulation times increased proportionally with dose when 300Â Â°C preheats were used, up to 30Â kGy of beta irradiation for two of the samples, but the given gamma doses were underestimated by 15â23%. Refinement of the present measurement protocol may improve assessment of the gamma doses, and the short term stability of the signal needs to be characterised, but the observed level of accuracy is already sufficient to provide approximate estimates for severity of radiation exposure. The present study has identified certain elements of \{OSL\} and \{TTOSL\} signals that can be used, in combination with a relatively severe preheating regime, to retrospectively evaluate doses of tens of kGy: beyond the range traditionally possible using quartz. },

  Abstract                 = {Radon levels measured for any duration less than one year are subject to seasonal variation. Such radon measurements must therefore be adjusted using an appropriate seasonal correction factor in order to estimate an annual average radon level. Radon mapping has shown that radon concentrations vary between regions within a country but there has been little work examining regional variation in the seasonality of radon levels. This paper investigates this regional variation in indoor radon seasonality in Ireland. Mean regional seasonal correction factors are estimated through Fourier decomposition and we find that there is significant regional variation in the computed seasonal correction factors. We conclude that the use of one national set of mean seasonal correction factors may not be appropriate in all countries. },

  Abstract                 = {During orthovoltage x-ray radiotherapy dosimetry, normal practice requires the use of a standard ionisation chamber and dedicated electrometer for dosimetry. In ideal conditions, the electrometer is positioned outside the treatment room to eliminate any effects from scatter radiation on dose measurement. However in some older designed rooms, there is no access portal for the chamber cable to run to an âoutsideâ position for the electrometer. As such the electrometer is positioned within the treatment room. This work quantifies the effects on measured charge when this occurs. Results have shown that with the electrometer positioned next to a solid water dosimetry stack and using a large 15Â ÃÂ 15Â cm field at 250Â kVp x-ray beam energy, charge results can deviate by up to Â±17.2% depending on the polarity applied to the chamber compared to readings when the electrometer is outside the treatment room. It is assumed to be due to scatter radiation producing electrons in the amplifying circuit of the electrometer. Results are also shown when the electrometer is shielded by a 4Â mm thick lead casing whilst inside the room which removes the scattering effect, providing the best case scenario when the electrometer must remain in the treatment room. Whilst it is well known that an electrometer should not be irradiated (even to scattered radiation), often small kilovoltage or orthovoltage rooms do not have a portal access for an electrometer to go outside. As such it would be recommended for a lead shield to be placed around the electrometer during irradiation if this was to occur to minimize dosimetric inaccuracies which may occur due to scattered radiation effects. },

These experiments illustrate the high sensitivity and dose rate of our \{RL\} system, the negligible influence of the turntable movement on IR-RF signals and the effectiveness of the built in 395Â nm \{LED\} at bleaching IR-RF signals. We measure IR-RF ages on a set of samples with independent age control using a robust analytical method, which is able to detect any possible sensitivity change. Our IR-RF ages do not agree well with the independent age control; the ages of the younger samples (20â45Â ka) are significantly over-estimated while the ages of the older samples (â¼130Â ka) are significantly under-estimated. Experiments are undertaken to investigate this disagreement and our results indicate that they can most likely be explained by 1) the difficulty of defining the correct bleaching level prior to regeneration measurements, 2) signal instability, 3) sensitivity changes between the additive dose and regenerative dose measurements, or a combination of these three factors. },

The measurements have been made varying the geometric and spectral conditions, corresponding to the most radiographic techniques employed in conventional and computer mammographic procedures, i.e., beam qualities in the range of 0.35â0.43Â mmAl, tube voltages from 25Â kV to 32Â kV, anode/filter combinations (Mo/Mo, Mo/Rh and Rh/Rh), different focus-image detector distances from 56Â cm to 66Â cm, area of irradiation (81, 157, 234 and 432Â cm2) and thickness of the phantom. Results indicate that \{BSF\} values show a slight dependence on the various parameters considered, except with the variation of the focus-film distance, where found that this parameter does not have influence on the BSF. \{ESD\} values show a strong dependence on the various parameters considered, showing substantially lower values (40%) for computer mammography. \{RDD\} curves decrease nearly exponentially with the depth and depend strongly on the spectral conditions. The obtained values show a satisfactory agreement with other studies obtained through Monte Carlo simulation, ionization chambers and thermoluminescent dosimeters. },

  Abstract                 = {Feldspar as an archaeological and geological natural material for dating and retrospective dosimetry isÂ receiving more and more attention because of its useful luminescence properties. In this study, the 25â280Â K thermoluminescence (TL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectra in albite, which is a component of the two main feldspar series, the alkali feldspar (Na, K)AlSi3O8 and the plagioclases (NaAlSi3O8âCaAl2Si2O8) have been presented for aliquots along (001) and (010) crystallographic orientations. There are four main emission bands that are considered to arise from complexes of intrinsic defects linked in larger complexes with impurities such as Na+, Mn2+ or Fe3+ ions. The consequence of their association is to produce different luminescence efficiencies that produce wavelength sensitive \{TL\} curves. Radioluminescence data at low temperature for albites is distorted by contributions from the \{TL\} sites, even when the \{RL\} is run in a cooling cycle. This indicates the potential for a far more general problem for analysis of low temperature \{RL\} in insulating materials. },

  Abstract                 = {\{PADC\} detectors are commonly used both as radon detectors and as personal dosemeters for neutron radiation. In both cases the measurement in workplace fields are characterized by long term irradiations, lasting up to several months. During this period the detectors undergo to uncontrolled and unmonitored environmental conditions. In a recent work the same authors demonstrated that the environmental conditions, mainly temperature, can seriously affect the detector sensitivity. The temperature effect is to reduce the V ratio by decreasing the track etching velocity Vt. This causes a decrease in limit angle and efficiency. This paper describes the same ageing/fading test made with \{CR39\} from a different supplier. In this case it seems that the temperature has a negligible effect, so no compensation algorithm is needed. },

The work presented in this paper shows the recommendations that were formulated by the results obtained from both measurements and simulations. The presented guidelines are directed to operators, assistant personnel, radiation protection officers and medical physics experts. They concern radiation protection issues, such as the use of room protective equipment, as well as the positioning of the extremity and eye lens dosemeters for routine monitoring. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Dosimetric validation of prescribed clinical plans in ocular proton therapy requires the use of adapted instrumentation providing high accuracy and spatial resolution. The aim of this work was to develop two independent tools based on Monte Carlo (MC) and \{EBT3\} films to perform high spatial resolution longitudinal dose maps in water for clinical Spread-Out Bragg peaks (SOBP). The first tool is based on \{EBT3\} films, irradiated in beam alignment with a tilt angle of 7Â° and scanned with high resolution of 300Â dpi. Dedicated software was developed to convert Pixel Values (PV) to absolute dose, which makes use of a calibration curve and a correction function of the \{LET\} based on MC. \{MC\} tool was implemented to generate dose maps in a grid plane with the same configuration (300Â dpi, longitudinal alignment, tilt angle of 7Â°). Both tools were tested for a same \{SOBP\} and two collimators of different shapes and apertures. Validation of \{EBT3\} and \{MC\} methods was performed by dose map comparison (gamma index test) to a silicon diode and film, respectively. Good agreement was found between diode and film (gamma index &gt;99%) and between \{MC\} and film (gamma index &gt;83%). At the plateau, accuracy in dose is better than 0.3% and maximum divergences are of 5% at the \{SOBP\} entrance, for both tools. Inconvenience of films is high pixel dispersion (2.3%) and uncertainty in film positioning. \{MCNPX\} overestimates angular deflection of Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS) and involves lateral profiles 0.5Â mm wider at 20% isodose. The mesh tally size in the transversal direction has an impact on dose distributions if spherical or cylindrical beam modifiers are used due to dose convolution in a larger mesh volume, reflected in a slight underdose at lateral edges in deeper depths. The defaults of \{EBT3\} and \{MC\} tools concern localized areas outside the Planning Target Volume (PTV) and therefore could potentially be used to perform dosimetric validation of prescribed clinical plans. Work is in progress to further explore their potential and limitations. },

Responses were analysed in function of the radionuclide, detector effective thickness and irradiation geometry. On the other hand the results of the nuclear medicine measurement campaign of the \{ORAMED\} project were presented focussing on the dose distribution across the hand and on the appropriate position to wear the dosimeter. According to the results, thin LiF detectors provide better responses in all cases. Its use is essential for 18F, since thick dosimeters can underestimate Hp(0.07) up to a 50% because of the very inhomogeneous dose deposition on the active layer. The preliminary results of the measurement campaign showed that the index tip of the non-dominant hand is usually the most exposed position among the 22 monitored positions. It was also found that, in average, wrist dosimeters are likely to underestimate the maximum skin dose by a factor of the order of 20. This factor is reduced to around 6 for a ring dosimeter worn on the base of the index of the non-dominant hand. Thus, for typical nuclear medicine procedures, the base of the index of the non-dominant hand is recommended as the best monitoring option. },

A large measurement campaign was organised within the framework of the \{ORAMED\} project to determine the dose distribution across the hands received during preparation and administration of 18F- and 99mTc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The final data, collected over almost 3 years, include 641 measurements from 96 workers in 30 \{NM\} departments from 6 European countries. Results have provided levels of reference doses for the considered standard \{NM\} diagnostic procedures (mean maximum normalised skin dose of 230Â Î¼Sv/GBq, 430Â Î¼Sv/GBq, 930Â Î¼Sv/GBq and 1200Â Î¼Sv/GBq for the administration of 99mTc, preparation of 99mTc, administration of 18F and preparation of 18F, respectively). Finger dose was analysed as a function of the potential parameters of influence showing that shielding is the most efficient means of radiation protection to reduce skin dose. An appropriate method for routine monitoring of the extremities is also proposed: the base of the index finger of the non-dominant hand is a suitable position to place the ring dosemeter, with its sensitive part oriented towards the palm side; its reading may be multiplied by a factor of 6 to estimate the maximum local skin dose. Finally, results were compared to earlier published data, which correspond mostly to individual works with a reduced number of workers and measurements. },

Energy, dose-rate, temperature and angular dependences of the detector response to 192Ir \{HDR\} brachytherapy fields were investigated, as well as sensitivity reproducibility and linearity. To this aim, two ad hoc phantoms were designed and developed to perform measurements in water. Intra-session reproducibility resulted to be very high, however inter-session reproducibility showed too high statistical variation. Detector response resulted to increase linearly with dose (R2Â =Â 0.997), with no evidence of energy and dose-rate dependence. Sensitivity resulted to increase linearly with temperature (R2Â =Â 0.995), with a 0.2% increase each Â°C. Finally, no significant angular dependence for the source moving around a circle in the azimuthal plane centered at the scintillator was observed. The obtained results show that the proposed detector is suitable for inÂ vivo real-time dosimetry in high dose rate brachytherapy. },

  Abstract                 = {Due to the complexity and the many steps involved in a high dose rate brachytherapy process, radiation dose delivered to the patient during the treatment is susceptible to many inaccuracies and may not accurately match the planned dose. In vivo dosimetry is a reliable solution to compare planned and delivered dose distributions, representing therefore a valid tool to systematically perform a quality control of the radiotherapic process and eventually increment treatment accuracy. In this study, Fricke gel dosimetric catheters (FGDC) were investigated to perform dose distribution measurements of a brachytherapy implant. The brachytherapy implant was established in a water phantom with five flexible plastic needles and irradiation was performed with a high dose rate remote afterloading device provided with an Ir-192 radioactive source. Comparison between dose distributions measured with ten \{FGDC\} located in the proximity of the implant needles and calculated by the treatment planning system shows very good agreement for seven out of ten dosimeters, whereas the remaining three show a local underestimation of the dose. In phantom results indicate that Fricke gel dosimetric catheters might be valid candidates for performing inÂ vivo dosimetry in high dose rate brachytherapy. However, further measurements are still required to validate this dosimetric method. },

  Abstract                 = {Terrestrial Cosmogenic Nuclides (TCNs) have been widely used to date the exposure of alluvial surfaces and to estimate catchment-scale erosion rates. However, \{TCN\} concentration differences in samples of different grain sizes remain to be fully understood. In order to explore the possibility that river processes generate such differences, we develop a numerical model to calculate along-stream clast-scale \{TCN\} concentrations. Using the hillslope model, there is a progressive detachment of successive clasts of specific sizes followed by their instantaneous fall into the river. In the river, transport velocity and \{TCN\} concentration evolution in a clast depend 1) on the probability of being trapped in the sediment mixing layer of the river or within an adjacent terrace; 2) on its size which decreases downstream by attrition. The size-dependent transport law corresponds to the partial transport state in a river. We model the distribution of \{TCN\} concentrations in different clast size fractions in the 0â5 cm radius range for catchments in steady-state erosion, and for catchments experiencing sedimentation. We propose that clast attrition tends to increase the variance of \{TCN\} concentrations of the small clast size fractions because these fractions incorporate initially big clasts that travelled a long distance in addition to small clasts contributed near the outlet. We obtained numerous clast sizeâTCN concentration correlations, positive or negative, the significance of which depends on the initial clast size distribution, hillslope erosion rate, river length and lithology. For an equilibrium catchment, even large, we found that the addition of \{TCN\} concentration acquired during river transport is negligible compared to \{TCN\} concentration acquired on a hillslope, although a clast sizeâTCN concentration relationship can result from or be modified by clast attrition. On the contrary, aggrading catchments may show a significant clast size-dependent \{TCN\} concentration increase during river transport. This may introduce a small bias in the TCN-derived catchment erosion rate, but it could be used positively to quantify the mean transport velocity of clasts of different sizes over thousands of years. In addition, the lack of correlation between \{TCN\} concentration and clast size does not imply that the mean transport velocity is the same for all clast size fractions. Overall, our study provides an alternative explanation for observed clast size-dependent \{TCN\} concentrations and brings to the fore the need for measuring \{TCN\} concentration in larger clast size fractions than is usually done. To see if the byproducts of abrasion dilute or increase the \{TCN\} concentration of sand, all products should be included in a future study. },

  Abstract                 = {NaI(Tl) and LaBr3(Ce) detectors are frequently operated under unstable temperature conditions when used in an open environment. These temperature changes result in a peak shift and spectral distortion during measurement. Two methods are proposed to stabilise the measured spectra; they are applied using a software algorithm, without the necessity of adjusting the gain. Both methods are based on the experimental observation that the relative channel displacement due to temperature changes is approximately the same for all channels. The first method corrects the spectrum using experimental data obtained under controlled conditions in the laboratory, and thus it only depends on the detector temperature. The second method uses one known peak in the spectrum to correct all of the channels: the \{NORM\} 40K peak for the NaI(Tl) detector, the internal contaminant peak of 138La for the LaBr3(Ce), or an external source when these two cannot be easily identified. },

  Abstract                 = {Inhalation of radon (Rn-222) and its progeny is one of the most significant sources of natural radiation exposure of the population. Nowadays, high radon exposures have been shown to cause lung cancer and many governments all over the world have therefore recommended that radon exposures in dwellings and indoor workplaces should be limited. Radon levels in buildings vary widely from area to area depending on local geology. This paper presents the results of a long-term survey of radon concentrations carried out from 2005 till 2010 in schools and dwellings of Eastern Sicily, using the solid-state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) technique. The investigated area shows medium-high indoor radon concentrations, higher than the Italian average of about 70 Bq/m3, with peaks of 500 Bq/m3 or more in buildings near active faults. Fortunately, only a small fraction of the measurements, about 1.5% of total, was found greater than \{EU\} and Italian action limits for indoor and workplaces. },

Effective doses for coronary angiography and calcium scoring without using automatic tube current modulation are respectively 12.72Â Â±Â 2.06 and 1.69Â Â±Â 0.30Â mSv. Using automatic tube current modulation can reduce effective dose by 43% for coronary angiography, and 24â32% for calcium scoring. Scatter doses at the point of 10Â cm away from the margin of scanning region decreased to 5â9% of in-plane doses.

  Abstract                 = {Computed Tomography (CT) becomes more and more important and is frequently used in modern diagnostic techniques. \{CT\} offers an effective diagnosis on lesion and pathology; however, it also delivers a radiation dose to patients. Besides, in some special emergency cases, the patient may require someone to help him in the examination room to perform the head CT, due to the patient lost intellectual and operational capacity. This study evaluated the delivered radiation dose and the risk of radiation-induced cancer for the patient and for the helper after carrying out the emergent head \{CT\} examination. A Rando phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) chips inside relevant organs was used to simulate the patient during head \{CT\} examination. An effective dose of 2.06Â Â±Â 0.16Â mSv and 1.46Â Â±Â 0.07Â mSv without and with wearing the lead apron were found respectively, considering \{ICRP\} 60 recommendation. \{ICRP\} 103 recommendations the readings would have been 1.29Â Â±Â 0.15Â mSv and 0.71Â Â±Â 0.04Â mSv. The effective dose determined from the dose-length product (DLP) method (2.19Â mSv) was similar to the value (2.06Â Â±Â 0.16Â mSv) estimated by \{TLD\} method considering the \{ICRP\} 60 recommendation (without lead apron). Assuming a 5% total risk for fatal cancer per Sv in the general population, risk of radiation-induced cancer for patients were 1.03Â ÃÂ 10â2% (without lead apron) and 7.80Â ÃÂ 10â3% (with lead apron) for \{ICRP\} 60, and were 6.45Â ÃÂ 10â3% (without lead apron) and 3.55Â ÃÂ 10â3% (with lead apron) for \{ICRP\} 103. The dose received by the helper was assessed by wearing a personal badge. The helper during emergent head \{CT\} examination may receive a personal dose equivalent (Hp(10)) of 19.36Â Â±Â 5.89Â Î¼Sv and 138.81Â Â±Â 101.28Â Î¼Sv with and without lead apron, respectively, at distance of 0.3â1Â m from the center of \{CT\} scanner. Based on the observed dose reduction of a factor of 7.17 we recommend that helpers wear lead apron in the \{CT\} examination room. },

  Abstract                 = {This study proposes to implement a realistic X-ray source and a high definition voxelised human model, VIP-Man into a Monte Carlo simulation for chest examination. A detailed simulation of a diagnostic X-ray dose requires three major inputs: operation conditions, X-ray spectral and spatial distributions, and a human model. This study collected commonly-used operation parameters such as kVp, mAs, and \{SSD\} for chest X-ray examinations. These parameters were inputted to a Monte Carlo code, BEAMnrc, to build a virtual X-ray machine for calculating X-ray spectral and spatial distributions. After that, a high resolution voxelised human model, VIP-Man, was constructed from a segmented Visible Male Dataset, and was irradiated with our virtual X-ray machine. X-ray spectra simulated using \{BEAMnrc\} were almost identical to those listed in the literature, or from a spectra simulator, XCOMP3. Heel effects could be observed in our simulation of X-ray spatial distribution. The simulated organ doses were compared to those published in NRPB-R262. There is some significant dose deviation between our results and NRPBâs, owing to the differences in stature and anatomical features, especially for liver, \{GI\} tract, lung, pancreas, and red bone marrow. These deviations are mainly caused by the different volume and position of the organs between the mathematical model and VIP-Man. },

  Abstract                 = {InÂ vivo dosimetry, which is commonly practised in Europe and North America, is a purely measurement-based check which can independently verify the entire treatment procedure. InÂ vivo dosimetry can be performed using either one or two detectors (i.e. diodes), and the later one applying two detectors in both the entrance and exit surface can independently verify the patientsâ dose. However, this type of two-detector measurement can only be implemented with tumours of symmetric geometry at the midline, and can only be applied to opposite large-field irradiation. Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is the most interesting symmetric cancer to medical physicists in Asia since it preferentially occurs in 40â50 year old males who have familial responsibilities. The tissues/structures around the nasopharynx are more complicated than those around the prostate, and may introduce unwanted bias to inÂ vivo dosimetry. Asymmetry and inhomogeneity are the most important systematic uncertainties with inÂ vivo dosimetry. This study demonstrates the bias of inÂ vivo dosimetry caused by tissue asymmetry and heterogeneity, and provides corrections accordingly. We have demonstrated that asymmetry correction reduced the uncertainty of deviation between inÂ vivo dosimetry and the prescribed dose from 3.12% to 2.39% for inÂ vivo dosimetry of 102 patients. Heterogeneity correction reduced the mean deviation between inÂ vivo dosimetry and the prescribed dose from 0.56% to 0.22%. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) dating protocols have been suggested as a means of extending the age range of luminescence dating. Several studies demonstrate that TT-OSL signals increase with large radiation doses (&gt;2000Â Gy) and yet, few studies report older TT-OSL ages (&gt;400Â Gy) in agreement with independent absolute age control. In one such study, agreement with independent chronology was only achieved for the old samples by implementing a pulsed-irradiation procedure. Pulsed-irradiation is suggested to compensate for dose rate dependent competition effects by dividing the laboratory irradiation into discrete irradiation steps interspersed with heat treatments. However, every inter-step heat treatment has the potential to anneal part of the TT-OSL dating signal. This study compares constant- and pulsed-irradiation TT-OSL protocols and investigates the degree of partial thermal annealing. The results suggest that almost all of the difference in outcome between constant- and pulsed-irradiation protocols can be explained by partial annealing of the TT-OSL signal rather than by competition effects. Partial annealing distorts the laboratory dose response curve but has no impact on the natural signal, resulting in unreliable equivalent dose estimates. This means that pulsed-irradiation procedures may not be viable for TT-OSL dating measurements. Future studies implementing pulsed-irradiation procedures should carefully consider the extent to which inter-step thermal treatments partially anneal the signal. },

The alpha radioactive content present in tobacco smoke and increasing number of lung cancer cases explain the importance of investigation. The use of different fertilizers may cause alteration in the metabolism of plants causing different response towards uptake of different element and radionuclides. In the present study, the estimation of alpha radioactivity induced by use of different fertilizers in tobacco leaves was made using solid state nuclear track detector (LR-115) to identify the relative presence of radionuclides in the plants. The radon exhalation rates from the tobacco plant were carried out to confirm the presence of radium or emission of radon from plant. The elemental analysis of tobacco plant by inductively coupled argon plasma atomic emission spectrometry provides a way to understand the difference occurred in metabolism caused by the use of fertilizers. The alpha track densities were found to vary with nature of fertilizers added to the soil and an increase was also observed with time. The radon mass exhalation rates in various tobacco plants were found to vary with type of fertilizers used. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The concentration of radon in soil usually varies between a few kBq/m3 and tens or hundreds of kBq/m3 depending upon the geographical region. This causes the transport of radon from the soil to indoor environments by diffusion and advection through the pore space of concrete. To reduce indoor radon levels, the use of concrete with low porosity and a low radon diffusion coefficient is recommended. A method of reducing the radon diffusion coefficient through concrete and hence the indoor radon concentration by using silica fume to replace an optimum level of cement was studied. The diffusion coefficient of the concrete was reduced from (1.63Â Â±Â 0.3)Â ÃÂ 10â7 to (0.65Â Â±Â 0.01)Â ÃÂ 10â8Â m2/s using 30% substitution of cement with silica fume. The compressive strength of the concrete increased as the silica-fume content increased, while radon exhalation rate and porosity of the concrete decreased. This study suggests a cost-effective method of reducing indoor radon levels. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Sr3Al2O5Cl2:Eu2+, Pr3+ phosphor has been synthesized via high temperature solid state reaction. The X-ray powder diffraction confirms that the obtained samples are pure orthorhombic Sr3Al2O5Cl2 phases, with a space group of D24-P212121. Blue green emission is observed when the sample is doped with Pr3+ ions and an orange red emission with Eu2+ ions doping. Both of the samples show obvious afterglow emission. The intensity and lifetime of such afterglow can be substantially enhanced in the case of Pr3+-Eu2+ co-doped, whose afterglow can last for approximately 300Â min in the dark and the intensity is five times higher than the sample single doped with Eu2+. According to the thermoluminescence glow curves, the trap depth of these double-doped samples is about 0.95Â eV, which is suitable for the generation of afterglow luminescence. And Pr3+ ions help to enhance the traps concentrations and modify the trap depth, which contributes to prolong the afterglow duration and increase the afterglow intensity of the phosphors. Finally, a feasible explanation of this afterglow generation is also discussed in this work. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A model of thermoluminescence (TL) is presented based on a double-occupancy electron trap and a single-hole recombination center. The concept of double-electron traps has been established before with regard to different solid state phenomena and briefly mentioned as a possible occurrence in connection with TL. A new set of simultaneous differential equations governing the three stages of excitation, relaxation and readout of \{TL\} in this new framework is developed. This situation is dealt with by solving these sets of equations sequentially for reasonable sets of chosen trapping parameters. Also, an analytical treatment using plausible simplifying assumptions is given in parallel. The outcome of these procedures yields a two-peak \{TL\} curve and, in a sense, the two-electron trap behaves as two traps with different activation energies, frequency factors and retrapping probabilities. The results of the simulations and the approximate analytical approach show that the lower-temperature peak has features of first-order peak and is strongly superlinear with the dose of excitation. With the appropriate choice of parameters, the dose dependence of the first peak has been found to be cubic and slightly more than cubic with the excitation dose. This may explain experimental results of cubic and somewhat stronger superlinearity previously reported in the literature. The second peak has second-order features and it shifts dramatically to lower temperatures with increasing dose. },

  Abstract                 = {A thermoluminescence (TL) model of two-stage stimulation of electrons into the conduction band is discussed. This release of the carriers is assumed to take place via an intermediate localized excited state. Electrons are thermally stimulated from the trap into an excited state and then thermally released into the conduction band from which they may either be retrapped or recombine with holes in centers. The model resembles the previous âsemi localizedâ model, but we concentrate only on recombination of electrons that go through the conduction band. It also bears similarity to the effect of thermally-assisted optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) previously discussed in the literature. The model is studied by solving the set of the relevant four simultaneous differential equations which govern the process during heating or isothermal decay. Using different sets of parameters, we can get pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order as well as intermediate cases, which are identified by their symmetry coefficient. Once the effective order is established, different analytical methods are used to determine the effective activation energy and frequency factor. We used the peak-shape methods, the various heating rate (VHR) method and the method based on the change of phosphorescence decay with temperature. The results are compared to the parameters used in the simulation. In many cases, the effective activation energy is equal to E1Â +Â E2 where \{E1\} and \{E2\} are, respectively, the activation energies for the first and second stage of thermal stimulation. The numerical simulation results are accompanied by an analytical treatment using the usual quasi-steady assumption. Unusual cases, in which the effective frequency factor and the effective retrapping probability coefficient are temperature dependent, are identified. Some cases in which the effective activation energy is close to \{E1\} rather than E1Â +Â E2 are identified and discussed. The relevance of this possible situation to the evaluation of the stability of \{TL\} signals is also considered, and a possible effect of anomalous stability is predicted. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the study of thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and in particular in the applications of archaeological and geological dating as well as dosimetry, the issue of stability of the signal at ambient temperature following excitation is of paramount importance. In many cases, one determines the activation energy (E) and frequency factor (s) of a \{TL\} peak, and tries to evaluate the lifetime of the excited signal. This is meaningful if the process is of pure first order, and may not be so in non-first-order situations. In the present work, we study this matter for both first-order and the more general one-trap-one-recombination-center (OTOR) cases using numerical simulations. The conventional numerical solution of the relevant set of coupled differential equations may not work when the traps are deep and the length of time is, say, thousands of years or more, and we therefore resort to a Monte-Carlo approach. It is obvious that in instances of dominating recombination, the long-time decay is exponential, and the decay constant is as expected from the first-order behavior and the E and s values. However, in cases of substantial retrapping, the fading is slower, sometimes very significantly, and is not exponential. Thus, one may deduce from the evaluated E and s shorter decay times than occur in fact. This may lead to an apparent effect of unexpected stability, namely, that a signal is stable much longer than expected from the evaluated trapping parameters. Possible implications concerning applications in archaeological and geological dating are obvious. },

  Abstract                 = {Assessments of radiation dose and image quality are required in diagnostic radiography for quality assurance and optimization studies. In work currently being undertaken, dose indices were measured and image quality evaluated for a chest \{PA\} procedure. Thermoluminescent dosimeters of the GR-200 type were attached to the entrance and exit surfaces and placed at various depths of the \{PMMA\} phantom to measure the entrance surface dose, the exit surface dose, and the organ dose index. The effective dose was estimated from the entrance surface dose using \{PCXMC\} software. Two contrast-detail image plates, one with air holes for the low contrast objects and the other with gypsum holes for the high contrast objects, were used to obtain radiographic images. This image plate was placed at different depths from the entrance surface of the phantom to simulate objects at different positions in the body. Each image was evaluated by three independent radiologists to determine image quality. Analyses of radiation dose versus image quality were performed to determine the optimal technical factors such as, filtration and tube potential. It was found that an 11-cm thick \{PMMA\} phantom best simulated the patients. The fractional dose backscattered from this phantom was between 22% and 27% for kVpâs between 66 and 133. Optimization analyses showed that no extra filter was required. For low contrast objects, an optimal choice of tube potential was 120Â kVp. For high contrast objects, a kVp as low as 77Â kVp could be used, depending on the image quality requirement. },

The radon concentration was found to increase from 54Â Â±Â 29 to 983Â Â±Â 65Â Bq/m3 as a step function of production time, or cumulative production. The observed radon behavior can be explained by a radial composite model with the carbonate scales deposited in the skin zone near the well. The radius of skin zone near well IC-09 can be estimated with radon data at about 20Â m using a plug flow model. Monitoring natural radon during the well flow tests is a helpful tracer to diagnose the formation damage near the well. },

The small part of the film contained one uranium-bearing particle is then cut off and transferred to a filament of TIMS; (3) Isotopic ratio of the particle is determined by TIMS. The problem of particles losing has been avoided in the process of sample preparing, particle locating and transferring. The deviation of the result from the certified value of \{CRM\} was less than 5%. },

Peripheral blood from two healthy men was irradiated in vitro with doses of 60Co gamma-rays ranging from 6 to 22 Gy at a dose rate of 2.0 Gy/min. Lymphocytes were concentrated, cultured and harvested at 52 h, 68 h and 72 h. The numbers of dic + r were counted. The doseâeffect curves were established and validated using comparisons with doses from the Tokai-mura accident and were then applied to two victims of supra-high dose exposure accident. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in chromosome aberration frequency among the different culture times from 52 h to 72 h. The 6â22 Gy doseâeffect curve was fitted to a linear quadratic model Y = â2.269 + 0.776D â 7.868 Ã l0â3D2. Using this mathematic model, the dose estimates were similar to data from Tokai-mura which were estimated by \{PCC\} ring. Whole body average doses of 9.7 Gy and 18.1 Gy for two victims in the Jining accident were satisfactorily given. We established and successfully applied a new doseâeffect curve of chromosomal dicentrics plus ring (dic + r) after 6â22 Gy Î³-irradiation from a supra-high dose 60Co gamma-ray accident. },

  Abstract                 = {In order to improve the scanning efficiency of commercial optical computed tomography (OptCT) scanners which use a conventional scanning laser, a novel optical \{CT\} scanner is being developed which employs a laser-based line source for the gel-scanning process. This line-source laser system can generate a uniform and parallel illumination profile in a line pattern, and consists of a Gaussian spot laser, a beam shaping module to convert a Gaussian laser beam into a 90Â° fan-angle line pattern with flat-top profile, and a set of cylindrical lenses which converts the rays into parallel light. The optical \{CT\} scanner consists of a gel cylinder mounted inside the scanning tank, two scanning motors to operate the rotations and translations of the gel cylinder, and a \{CCD\} detector to record the image data. We present our analysis of the sources of uncertainty and evaluate the basic performance parameters of the optical \{CT\} scanner in conjunction with polymer gel dosimeters. To improve dose accuracy of this prototype, it may also be necessary to decrease the wall thicknesses of both the gel container and the matching liquid tank and more precisely to match the refractive indices of the whole system. },

The light yield non-proportionality and energy resolution versus energy of gamma rays were measured and the intrinsic resolution of the crystals was determined after correcting the measured energy resolution for \{PMT\} statistics. The LuAG:Pr(0.19%) showed a good proportionality of the light yield within 5% over the energy range from 1274.5Â keV down to 32Â keV, which is much better than that of 14% for BGO.

A comprehensive dosimetric evaluation of an in-house developed 10Â MeV industrial electron beam irradiator was carried out in static as well as in dynamic mode of irradiations.

The dose rate from the electron beam was also calculated using the empirical relation prescribed in the \{ASTM\} report E2232-02. The measured electron beam profile indicates the dose rate variation within 8% in the irradiated product boxes. The most probable energy determined from the depth dose distribution in PMMA, Al and water was found in agreement with the intended energy of the electron beam. Measured dose rate using radiochromic film and graphite calorimeter were found in good agreement with each other and also found comparable with the theoretically estimated dose rates. Experimentally measured dose rates were considered for the trial irradiation of medical and industrial products. Dosimetric data obtained through this study confirms the suitability of the irradiator for routine radiation processing of various products. },

The challenge of monitoring personal equivalent doses with \{APDs\} in interventional fluoroscopy is that they must be sensitive to low energy photon beams and be able to record high dose rates. The aim of this work is to verify both the performance and the reliability of four active personal dosemeters (APDs) and one direct ion storage (DIS) dosemeter in typical X-ray radiation fields used during interventional radiology and cardiology (IR/IC) procedures. The values of the personal dose equivalent at a depth of 10Â mm measured by the \{APDs\} are compared with the response of a whole body thermoluminescence dosemeter (TLD) as a reference dosemeter. The response is found to be satisfactory in the tested situations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The influence of annealing, irradiation dose, preheating and measurement temperature on luminescence lifetimes has been studied in quartz annealed at 1000Â Â°C. The measurements were supplemented by studies on quartz annealed at 900 and 800Â Â°C. Lifetimes increase with dose as well as with temperature and duration of annealing between 800 and 1000Â Â°C. Preheating produces the same effect. The changes are accounted for in terms of hole-transfer from the non-radiative luminescence centre to and between radiative centres. The influence of measurement temperature on lifetimes depends on whether the stimulation is carried out from ambient to 200Â Â°C or otherwise. This result is unlike that in quartz annealed at or below 500Â Â°C where lifetimes are independent of the direction of heating. In particular, lifetimes decrease monotonically when measurements are made from 20 to 200Â Â°C but not when recorded from 200 to 20Â Â°C. The latter produces a pattern resembling that in quartz annealed up to 500Â Â°C. The results are concluded as evidence of thermal effects on separate luminescence centres. In support of this, different values of the activation energy for thermal quenching were found for each supposed luminescence centre. The change of the corresponding luminescence intensity with temperature is also qualitatively consistent with this notion. },

  Abstract                 = {The amount of luminescence that can be measured from quartz changes significantly as do the corresponding luminescence lifetimes if the quartz is annealed before pulsed optical stimulation. Owing to its importance in retrospective dosimetry, natural quartz has been the subject of most such thermal studies. In this work, the influence of annealing and beta irradiation on luminescence lifetimes determined from time-resolved luminescence spectra and positron lifetimes evaluated from positron annihilation spectra has been investigated in synthetic quartz, a material with eclectic applications including dosimetry and defect-physics studies. Measurements on the influence of stimulation temperature on luminescence lifetimes and luminescence intensity are also reported. Luminescence lifetimes are independent of annealing up to about 500Â Â°C but increase thereafter suggesting the increasing importance of higher-lifetime luminescence centres. This interpretation is based on the energy band model for quartz used to explain luminescence lifetimes in which annealing induces the transfer of holes from a non-radiative luminescence center to and between radiative luminescence centres as is discussed in the text. Regarding the influence of measurement temperature on luminescence lifetimes, it was observed that lifetimes are strongly affected by measurement temperature particularly between about 120 and 200Â Â°C in a manner consistent with thermal quenching. On the other hand, the luminescence intensity determined from the same time-resolved luminescence spectra goes through a peak as a function of measurement temperature. The initial increase in luminescence intensity is attributed to thermal assistance to optical stimulation whereas the subsequent decrease is ascribed to thermal quenching of the luminescence. Values of the activation energy for thermal assistance and thermal quenching are given. Positron lifetimes in unannealed quartz and quartz annealed at 500Â Â°C are similar and independent of dose showing that irradiation or annealing did not produce new types of defects. The aim of this study is to improve understanding of the physical processes responsible for luminescence in synthetic quartz. },

  Abstract                 = {The K3Na(SO4)2: Eu phosphor has been prepared by chemical co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction studies show that K3Na(SO4)2: Eu phosphor exhibits hexagonal structure with average particle size of 42Â nm. The samples were irradiated with 1.2Â MeV Argon ions, with fluences varying between 1011 and 1015Â ions/cm2. Monte Carlo SRIM-2008 Simulation was used for evaluating ion range, ion energy loss and ion induced atomic displacements. Ions having a range of 2.09Â Î¼m lose their energy mainly via electronic stopping, by creating large number of defects and activating different trap centers. This results in composite thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves. The growth of lower temperature peak at around 449Â K which was linear in the whole studied dose range, might be attributed to the change in trap centers and luminescence centers populations. The observed variation in \{TL\} intensity of the higher temperature peak at 533Â K is the resultant effect of both increases in density of ion beam tracks and high ionization density. A photoluminescence (PL) emission peak is seen around 415Â nm when excited by 310Â nm light, due to transition from an excited state of 4f65d conï¬guration to 8S7/2 state of Eu2+ ion. The higher concentration of defects that generate nonradiative states within the band gap is responsible for decrease in \{PL\} intensity after irradiation. The composite \{TL\} glow peaks were first deconvoluted with GlowFit program and then kinetics parameters of isolated prominent peaks were calculated by the thermoluminescence peak shape and various heating rate methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Optical-cross section that is a trap parameter estimated from the measurements of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) is not a uniquely determined physical quantity. It depends not only on temperature and the energy of stimulation light but also, in the simplest case, on the optical depth of trap, the frequency of vibration mode and on the Huang-Rhys factor, i.e. the average number of phonons involved in the process of optical excitation of electrons from trap to conduction band. Conventional \{OSL\} measurement techniques do not enable to determine directly these parameters but they could be estimated by applying the variable energy of stimulation optically stimulated luminescence (VES-OSL) method. Recently it was put in to practice and the first VES-OSL curves were presented. In this study the outcomes of VES-OSL experiments are presented together with the first attempt of direct estimating the optical depth of traps active in \{OSL\} process in quartz. },

The significant changes of the relative contributions of individual components in the total signal with temperature have been observed. The share of fast and medium components decreases with temperature. The characteristic behaviour of the intensities of these components, found also in the computer simulations of equivalent \{OSL\} process, indicates that both components can be related to one trap. The share of the slow component increases clearly above 150Â Â°C. Because of the increase of the unstable super fast component above 80Â Â°C, the temperature range below this temperature has been indicated as the most safe for \{OSL\} measurement in \{OSL\} dating. },

  Abstract                 = {Conventional personal dosemeters designed for measurement of Hp(10) of photon exposure can approximate effective dose E (quantity of interest in radiation protection) only for situations when irradiation occurs from the front of a human body. It is known that for rear irradiation with lower energies dosemeter readout may significantly underestimate E. The aim of this study was to determine angular and energy dependences of E and estimate respective conversion coefficient from photon dosemeter readout to E for given (left chest) location of a dosemeter and based on such dependences theoretically elaborate a design of a dosemeter with uniform response in terms of E. Monte Carlo simulation was performed for different energies (50, 80, 100, 150 and 200Â keV) and incidence angles (with 30Â° increments both for polar and azimuth angles) for a number of plausible dosemeter designs. It was demonstrated that properly designed copper filter reduces variation of conversion coefficient by a factor of four, thus allowing more certain evaluation of effective dose of occupational exposure than dosemeters of conventional design may do. },

  Abstract                 = {Follow-up of the Chernobyl accident had included a good deal of retrospective dosimetry and dose reconstruction. Comparison of Chernobyl and Fukushima shows that despite some differences in course and scale of the two accidents, main elements are present in both situations and Chernobyl experience could be quite educative for better understanding and more optimal handling of Fukushima Dai-ichi accident consequences. This paper contains review of dose reconstruction efforts done to date and extensively published in scientific journals and reports. Specifically the following cases are considered: (i) evaluation of individual doses to evacuees; (ii) validation of ecological dosimetric models and ruling out unconfirmed dose rate measurements; dosimetric support of (iii) caseâcontrol study of leukemia among Chernobyl clean-up workers (liquidators), and (iv) cohort study of cataracts among liquidators. Due to limited size of this paper the given application cases are rather outlined while more detailed descriptions could be found in relevant publications. Each considered Chernobyl case is commented with respect to possible application to Fukushima Dai-ichi situation. The presented methodological findings and approaches could be used for retrospective assessment of human exposures in Fukushima. },

  Abstract                 = {The most of the algorithms reported on the deconvolution of the OSL/TL glow curve is basically based on the one trap one recombination center (OTOR) model. In the \{OTOR\} model, each individual trap is considered to be independent with each other (mutually exclusive with each other), and the total glow curve is produced solely by the summation of the glow peaks generated from the luminescence emitted by the electrons in one individual trap when transferring to other trap(s). Therefore, there could be a major difference between the model and real physical process of the OSL/TL mechanism. Because the electrons being excited to be in the conduction band barely have past recollection of the original traps, it is widely believed that electrons in one trap can be easily transferred to other trap via the conduction band. Particularly in case of the OSL, the effects of mutual interactions among the traps could be more dominant than those in case of the TL. An algorithm, which can be used to numerically analyze the OSL/TL curves with reflecting the mutual interactions among the individual traps via the conduction band, is developed. This algorithm is able to promptly generate the glow curves for a system with numerous electron traps and recombination centers. Thus, the algorithm can be used to effectively deconvolute the glow curve of a given measurement data. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si were deconvoluted with the introduction of enhanced physical model which envisages that both electrons and holes, produced by ionization radiation and trapped at the respective traps, can be thermally released into the conduction and the valence band, respectively and the holes may also radiatively recombine with electrons at the electron recombination centers. The model is more generalized than the ordinary trap interaction model which only permits the traffic of electrons through the conduction band. An effective numerical analysis method was developed to calculate the glow curve to be compatible with the measured curves. The validity of the numerical method was verified through artificially generated \{TL\} glow curves for a wide range of trap parameters. In order to identify \{TL\} kinetics of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si with higher accuracy, its glow curves were deconvoluted for two more generalized models, namely, the SchÃ¶nâKlasens model and the ChenâPagonisâLawless model as well as the ordinary trap interactive model. The parameters in the more generalized multi-trap multi-recombination center (MTMR) model were found to be consistent with the quasi-static approximation(QSA) method. },

  Abstract                 = {The results of \{EPR\} measurements performed due to our participation in the 4th International Comparison of \{EPR\} Dosimetry using tooth enamel were used to analyze the effects of modifications in numerical analysis of the measured spectra on precision and accuracy of reconstructed doses. The studied modifications included effects of: (1) a use of Mn2+ standard, (2) variations in experimental native background signals of tooth enamel used for dose reconstructions, (3) signal filtration, (4) subtraction of empty tube spectra, and (5) variations in the spectra ranges used for calculations (fitting windows). It was shown, that the use of a Mn standard, for normalization of intensities of the recorded signals in the spectra processing, strongly increased the dosimetric accuracy. The regression lines of the doses reconstructed using different background spectra against nominal doses, obtained without Mn standard, had slopes about 30% higher and their scatter range was about 2 times higher than the same parameters obtained when Mn standard was applied in the spectra processing. Accuracy of the measured doses characterized by root mean square deviations from the nominal doses was 71Â mGy for calculations with Mn standard and 241Â mGy without normalization to Mn lines. Despite the large beneficial effect of the use of Mn standard on accuracy (root mean square deviations of the data, slope of the regression lines), it did not significantly improve the dosimetry performance characterized by the critical dose and detection limit. The smoothing of the spectra by 9 point filtration resulted in 1.6% increase of the reconstructed doses. The subtraction of empty tube spectrum had no effect on precision and accuracy of the dose reconstruction. The performance parameters were also practically insensitive to a choice of a width of the spectral window used for the analysis, provided it encompassed the â¼1.6Â mT range covering the main peaks of the radiation induced signal in enamel. It was concluded, that a proper choice of the background spectrum has the strongest influence on quality of the retrospective dosimetry. Experimentally obtained background spectra subject to individual variations and their shape could be affected by sample preparation method, leading to inter-sample differences in their spectral components contributing to the radiation induced signal. This effect caused considerable (up to â¼300Â mGy) systematic errors in the reconstructed doses. },

  Abstract                 = {Active personal dosemeters (APD) have been found to be very efficient tools to reduce occupational doses in many applications of ionizing radiation. In order to be used in interventional radiology and cardiology (IR/IC), \{APDs\} should be able to measure low energy photons and pulsed radiation with relatively high instantaneous personal dose equivalent rates. A study concerning the optimization of the use of \{APDs\} in IR/IC was performed in the framework of the \{ORAMED\} project, a Collaborative Project (2008â2011) supported by the European Commission within its 7th Framework Program. In particular, eight commercial \{APDs\} were tested in continuous and pulsed X-ray fields delivered by calibration laboratories in order to evaluate their performances. Most of \{APDs\} provide a response in pulsed mode more or less affected by the personal dose equivalent rate, which means they could be used in routine monitoring provided that correction factors are introduced. These results emphasize the importance of adding tests in pulsed mode in type-test procedures for APDs. Some general recommendations are proposed in the end of this paper for the selection and use of \{APDs\} at IR/IC workplaces. },

  Abstract                 = {Olivine is an iron-magnesium solid solution silicate (Mg,Fe)2SiO4 and it is probably one of the most abundant mineral phase in the Solar System, it is present in the primitive carbonaceous meteorites (i.eÂ Allende), and in ordinary chondritic meteorite, comets or terrestrial planets. The olivine grains in those bodies have been exposed to different radiation sources like UV, electrons, cosmic radiation, etc. Here, we explore the effect of ionizing and non ionizing radiation on the luminescence emission of the two well-characterised olivine samples from Mexico and Spain by means of cathodoluminescence and thermoluminescence. The analyses by X-ray dispersive energies in the scanning electron microscopy show differences between the samples in the amount of iron and magnesium and also show traces of rare elements. Olivine exhibits spectral cathodoluminescence emissions of low intensity, explained for the quenching of the luminescence of the iron, and sharp signals assigned as impurities. Cathodoluminescence and thermoluminescence glow curves of the natural, and \{UV\} induced olivine samples were obtained. Our results show that thermal treatments at 1100Â Â°C change the mineral molecular structure and the luminescence properties of this mineral phase. These results confirm an active participation of physical factors influencing the luminescent properties of olivine. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Previous SAR-OSL dating studies using quartz extracted from Romanian and Serbian loess samples report SAR-OSL doseâresponse curves on fine grained (4â11Â Î¼m) quartz that grow to much higher doses compared to those of coarse-grained (63â90, 90â125, 125â180Â Î¼m) quartz. Furthermore, quartz SAR-OSL laboratory dose response curves do not reflect the growth of the \{OSL\} signal in nature. A main difference in coarse- and fine-grained quartz dating lies in the alpha irradiation history, but the effect of mixed alpha-beta fields has so far received little attention. In the present study we investigate whether the alpha dose experienced by fine grains over geological cycles of irradiation and bleaching may have an effect on the saturation characteristics of the laboratory dose response. By applying time resolved optically stimulated luminescence we confirm that the \{OSL\} signals induced in quartz by alpha and beta radiation follow the same recombination path. We also show that a mixed alpha-beta dose response reproduces the beta dose response only up to about 800Â Gy. Assuming an a-value of 0.04 we have shown that laboratory alpha and beta dose response curves overlap up to effective alpha doses of â¼50Â Gy. Based on these results, we conclude that exposure of fine grains to alpha radiation during burial and transport cycles prior to deposition, as well exposure to the mixed radiation field experienced during burial are not responsible for the age discrepancies previously reported on fine and coarse grained quartz extracted from Romanian and Serbian loess. },

Different annealing on several aliquots (from 480 to 960Â Â°C) induces several changes in the sensitivity of the sample probably associated with (i) dehydration and dehydroxylation processes and (ii) changes in the lattice structure increasing the Al/Si disorder giving rise to ionic self-diffusion of alkali atoms, thermal stress into atomic positions and variation in the concentration of alkali ions in planar defects. The complex structure of albite has several planar defects (twinning and exsolution interphases which contain hydroxyl groups, water molecules, etc.) that can act as luminescence centres.

  Abstract                 = {Most gemstones, being natural materials (silicates, carbonates, phosphates, etc.), exhibit luminescence emission. This property could be potentially employed for personal dosimetry in the case of radiation accident or radiological terrorism where conventional monitoring has not been established. We, herein, report on the thermoluminescence (TL), radioluminescence (RL) and infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) response of a well-characterised natural amazonite (KAlSi3O8) that, due to its bright blue-green colour when polished, is used as a gemstone. The luminescence emission wavelengths, intensities and thermal kinetics of the amazonite luminescence curves reveal that the ultraviolet band measured on amazonite aliquots is similar to other common K-rich feldspars. On this basis, one can conclude (i) association between twinning and the UV-blue \{TL\} emission can be related to structural defects located in the twin-domain boundaries where ionic alkali-self-diffusion, irreversible water losses and irreversible dehydroxylation processes can be involved. (ii) Amazonite exhibits a complex structure with several planar defects (twinning and exsolution interphases which can hold hydroxyl groups, water molecules, etc.) and point defects (impurities, Na, Pb, Mn, etc.) that can act as luminescence centres, and in fact, green and red emissions are respectively associated with the presence of Mn and Fe impurities. Finally, (iv) the thermal stability tests performed on the \{TL\} emission of the amazonite confirm a continuum in the trap distribution, i.e. progressive changes in the glow curve shape, intensity and temperature position of the maximum peak. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Radiation sources of 60Co are commonly measured by means of \{HPGe\} gamma spectrometers, either as unknown sources or as calibration sources. However, the two gamma rays that are emitted by this nuclide, at 1.17Â MeV and 1.33Â MeV respectively, follow each other so rapidly that in the cases where both photons interact with the crystal, the electronics will record a single additive pulse. This is a cascade or coincidence summing effect. Such effect induces in the gamma spectra a âsum-peakâ, appearing at 2.5Â MeV on the energy axis, generated by the pair of photons which have both been entirely absorbed by the detector. Also, the second photon is correlated for direction to the first one, i.e., it will not be emitted at random, with an isotropic probability. Then the question arises of to what extent the two effects, cascade and correlation, might affect the count rates for the three peaks. Various answers have already been published, but without practical solutions. In this context, the present work was devoted to further explore the question by means of Monte Carlo simulation, in the case of a welltype detector. As a result, inside the well the sum peak only is not affected and it allows accurate evaluation of the detector efficiency at 1.25Â MeV. Outside the well, near the detector, none of the three peaks can be directly used for efficiency evaluation, unless the relevant corrections can be evaluated. At a distance from the detector, the two single peaks can be used, but with the drawback of a low efficiency. },

  Abstract                 = {During nuclear medicine procedures technologists are exposed to relatively high extremity doses as a result of manipulation of syringes and vials. These manipulations also involve a risk on contamination with liquids that have a relatively high specific activity. Despite the fact that contaminations should be avoided by hygienic measures, they can occur by accidental spills or as a result of cross-contamination. It should be stated that even minor contaminations can lead to major extremity doses especially in the case of beta-emitters. This means that contamination survey followed by decontamination, where appropriate, is needed in routine practise. Regular survey by workers asks for self-discipline, is time-consuming and consequently often neglected. Moreover, the use of common contamination monitors does not reveal reliable quantitative data that can be used in calculation of cumulated doses. In this study contaminations were monitored during a long-term survey with a protocol based on fast identification, localisation and quantification. During the first 5 months of the survey 300 inspections were carried out among 10 technologists. Contamination was found in 28 (9%) cases (23 99mTc-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, 5 18FDG). All detected contaminations were highly localised with values ranging from 185Bq to 440Â kBq. The skin dose rates were calculated using different reference data and methods. The follow-up of individual contaminations resulted in the calculation of effective half-lives that are strongly radiopharmaceutical related. The use of these effective half-lives, the estimated exposure time and the reference data for dose rates resulted in a wide range of cumulated skin doses ranging from 8Â Î¼Sv to 33Â mSv. The first results of this survey indicate that extremity doses resulting from contaminations can have a large contribution to the total extremity dose of nuclear medicine technologists. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Measuring the double isotope atomic abundance ratio as function of time of a homogenized stock of plutonium using mass spectroscopy provides a means to estimate the half-life of 241Pu, denoted here as t1/2,241. After a logarithmic transformation, estimating t1/2,241 along with a justifiable associated uncertainty is reduced to the analysis of a linear relationship, as illustrated in this paper using 15 published data pairs (time, log(double isotope ratio)) of Wellum etÂ al. (2009) that span approximately 31 years (greater than two half-lives). However, as noted by Wellum etÂ al. (2009), the published 15 data pairs exhibit inconsistencies that indicate possible underestimation of individual experimental uncertainties. Similar inconsistencies often arise in multi-experiment comparisons of the same estimated quantity, typically because some components of uncertainty such as individual experimental biases are difficult to identify and assess. It is therefore an important and common problem. In such cases the experimental data must be supplemented with other information to make plausible uncertainty estimates. We therefore analyze the data pairs under several different assumptions regarding total experimental uncertainties and show quantitatively that the best estimate of t1/2,241 and of its uncertainty depend on the assumptions regarding experimental uncertainties. It is unlikely in this context that the 15 data pairs and associated estimated experimental uncertainties could guide one toward a very certain choice among the reasonable sets of assumptions regarding total experimental uncertainties. Thus a definitive recommendation cannot be singled out. Fortunately, the best estimates and associated uncertainties arising from different yet tenable assumptions regarding experimental uncertainties are all in reasonably close agreement. And, one of those best estimates we provide (with approximately 95% confidence limits) is (14.329Â Â±Â 0.006[fit]Â Â±Â 0.029[bias]) years, which uses similar data stratification arguments as in Wellum etÂ al. (2009) but a completely different approach. Furthermore, this estimate of t1/2,241 agrees closely with the value recommended in Wellum etÂ al. (2009) of (14.325Â Â±Â 0.024) years. We conclude that the value of t1/2,241 supported by the available data is robust, despite evidence of some non-ideal behavior, and that alternative means of estimating t1/2,241 and its uncertainty yield reasonably similar results. },

  Abstract                 = {In non-destructive assay there exist techniques founded on physics principles and experimental design for which the quantity of interest yTrue to be estimated is expected to vary in direct proportion to the true value xTrue of the experimentally observed predictor quantity x. In other words, the calibration is a straight line passing through the origin, so that the assay method is fully described by a single parameter, the slope. In principle a single reference item is sufficient to estimate the slope. However, there are good reasons for including more than a single item in the calibration procedure. When multiple items are used questions arise regarding how to make best use of all the available calibration data in estimating the slope. This paper shows that the usual weighted least squares curve fitting approach can be circumvented by using only the familiar notion of a weighted arithmetic mean. In particular we draw attention to the ease with which uncertainties in both x and y can be incorporated using this simple and direct approach. Moreover the uncertainty in the calibration parameter is estimated using familiar techniques and with an appropriate magnitude for subsequent use, for instance, in setting reasonable uncertainties on assay results performed using the calibration. For completeness, weighted least squares accounting for nonzero covariances among the measurements y of yTrue together with an errors in predictors approach accounting for errors in x is also presented. },

  Abstract                 = {A standard nondestructive assay technique for determining the mass of plutonium in an item is passive neutron coincidence counting. In passive neutron coincidence counting, the dead time or rate loss corrections for the singles and doubles neutron counting rates are routinely made using empirical relationships that are based on the design and performance of the individual counter used to make the measurements. The empirical methods were developed ahead of any supporting theory for dead time losses and have worked well to date for the majority of safeguards measurement scenarios. Modern applications using highly efficient systems with short neutron lifetimes together with the challenges posed by highly multiplying items mean dead time corrections of higher fidelity are needed. While many attempts have been made to develop dead time corrections that are based on the physical principles of the measurements being performed, these corrections have often been found to be difficult to implement in a real system. For instance, Matthes and Haas developed an approach in 1985 which did not gain favor largely because the form of the doubles correction apparently required numerical integration which was difficult to implement with the computer technology of that time. A recent review into the approach that was developed by Matthes and Haas has determined that a straightforward analytical expression can be derived for the doubles correction that is similar to the singles rate correction that was developed in their original work. An analysis of the expressions is presented here to show how they relate to the traditional empirical methods. Further, we illustrate their implications and limitations. For instance the empirical methods do not address within burst losses i.e. rate related losses due to the correlated neutron bursts from fission, whereas the Matthes and Hass expression for singles counting does exhibit such an effect. },

Understanding the limitations of the technique, and in particular the total measurement uncertainty, is crucial if quality results, fit for purpose, are to be reported. In this work, we show that the way in which the acquired data is analyzed can strongly influence the uncertainty assessment. We take a carefully performed set of Mn-bath measurements from the literature as our example and show that the same data when reanalyzed can be used to justify an uncertainty smaller by about an order of magnitude than was originally reported. This finding should caution all those involved in radiation measurements to critically assess their approach to data analysis and to perform a careful uncertainty analysis taking into account possible alternatives. },

To this end, we here present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation study with \{DOSRZnrc\} that investigated the influence of field and detector size for small 6Â MV photon beams. The study focusses on doses averaged over the volume of the detector rather than point doses. The ratio of volume averaged doses to water ( D Â¯ W ) and alanine ( D Â¯ det ) was found to be approximately 1.025 for most situations studied, and a constant ratio is likely to be representative for many applications in radiation therapy. However, D Â¯ W / D Â¯ det was found to be as low as 0.9908Â Â±Â 0.0037 in situations where one might expect significant deviations from charged particle equilibrium (i.e. at shallow depths and when the field size was smaller than the range of the secondary electrons). These effects therefore need consideration when finite-size alanine dosimeters are used under such conditions. },

In this work we have developed and tested an experimental technique to measure thoron generation rate in building material samples using \{RAD7\} radon-thoron detector. The mathematical model of the measurement technique provides the thoron concentration response of \{RAD7\} as a function of the sample thickness. For experimental validation of the technique an adobe building material sample was selected for measuring the thoron concentration at nineteen different sample thicknesses. Fitting the parameters of the model to the measurement results, both the generation rate and the diffusion length of thoron was estimated. We have also determined the optimal sample thickness for estimating the thoron generation rate from a single measurement. },

  Abstract                 = {Microbeam radiation therapy is an experimental technique utilising synchrotron X-rays collimated into a planar array of microbeams. Due to the complex structure of the radiation field and high dose rate, this introduces dosimetric challenges. Current dosimetric methods are inadequate in that they lack either real-time readout, or high spatial resolution. A detector system, consisting of the Silicon Multi-Strip Detector and associated readout system was developed at the University of Wollongong. This system performs online, real-time dosimetry, and is designed for placement upstream of the patient as a transmission detector. The interaction of synchrotron radiation with this detector, both in terms of perturbative effects on the beam and interactions within the detector are investigated with the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit, Geant4. The interaction percentage of the detector with the traversing beam was determined as being (1.97Â Â±Â 0.01) %. Energy deposition was found to be uniform across the depth of the detector, negating the most proximal and distal 5-Î¼m region, a phenomenon that may be attributed to a lack of charged particle equilibrium. The effect that the detector has on a traversing beamâs macroscopic dose deposition was determined as being a mean reduction in dose of (1.44Â Â±Â 0.15) % for depths in water between 5 and 35Â mm. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Luminescence dating of sediment requires the sand grains to have been exposed to sunlight prior to their most recent burial. Under fluvial transport, the amount of sunlight exposure may not always be sufficient to reset the luminescence signal, a phenomenon known as âpartial bleaching'. The extent of bleaching is dependent on a combination of geomorphic, sedimentological and fluvial processes. If bleaching can be quantified, and the relationship with these processes understood, it could potentially be used as a new environmental proxy for changes in the dynamics of river systems. Here, we use a recently developed statistical model to evaluate the extent of bleaching, by inferring the proportion of well-bleached grains in the small-aliquot population. We sampled low-flow and flood deposits at a single site on the River Sabie, South Africa. We show that the low-flow sediment is almost perfectly bleached (&gt;80% of grains well bleached), while sediment at flood elevations is partially bleached (20â70 % of grains well bleached). The degree of bleaching may show a relationship with flood magnitude as defined by elevation above normal river level, and we speculate on the causes of variability in bleaching between flood samples. },

The azimuthal angle of incidence of the ions was the same for the pieces 15Â°, 60Â°, 75Â° and 180Â° apart for the pieces 30Â° and 45Â°. Etching times were of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Â min (HF 40%, 35Â Â°C). The results show that etching velocities of ion tracks are higher in directions closer to the y-axis.

The neutron fluence measurements are carried out with metal-activation monitors or with uranium-fission monitors, co-irradiated with the samples. Uranium-fission monitors consist of either a thin âmono-atomicâ) film, or a thick fission source (standard uranium glass) irradiated against a muscovite external track detector. In this work, different techniques for performing neutron-fluence measurements were compared: based on thin-film calibration, based on thick-source calibration, and based on gamma spectrometry of co-irradiated metal monitors (Au, Co). The results suggest that more experiments are needed to make all calibrations consistent, including new measurements of the length of etched induced tracks in mica. Also the standard glass calibration carried out with thin films should be confirmed with a greater number of calibrating irradiations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The goal of this intercomparison is to determine the peripheral doses during treatment of prostate and head and neck (H&amp;N) cancers. In the case of prostate cancer, two different treatment techniques are compared: intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT â 10Â MV and 18Â MV), on a Varian Clinac 2100Â C/D and Tomotherapy. \{VMAT\} (also on a Varian Clinac 2100Â C/D) was compared to Tomotherapy, for H&amp;N cancer. The treatment devices are located at the university hospitals of Leuven and Brussels, respectively. A common treatment protocol was agreed between the two clinical centers and this same protocol was used by each partner. For the higher energy modalities (10Â MV and 18Â MV) we also assessed the neutron contribution to the total dose, by using bubble detectors. In this way, the performance (in terms of peripheral doses) of the different treatment techniques, when faced with the same dose distribution constraints, was evaluated. The doses were evaluated with an anthropomorphic phantom loaded with \{TLD\} detectors. Summarizing our results, we can conclude that low energy radiation techniques, namely \{VMAT\} and Tomotherapy, have more interesting performances when compared to \{IMRT\} at energies of 10Â MV and 18Â MV, with respect to peripheral dose. On the one hand the former are associated with lower photon doses and, on the other hand, there is no contribution from neutrons to the total dose. },

  Abstract                 = {Physicians who frequently perform fluoroscopic examinations are exposed to high intensity radiation fields. The exposure monitoring is performed with a regular personal dosimeter under the apron in order to estimate the effective dose. However, large parts of the body are not protected by the apron (e.g. arms, head). Therefore, it is recommended to wear a supplemental dosimeter over the apron to obtain a better representative estimate of the effective dose. The over-apron dosimeter can also be used to estimate the eye lens dose. The goal of this study was to investigate the relevance of double dosimetry in interventional radiology. First the calibration procedure of the dosimeters placed over the apron was tested. Then, results of double dosimetry during the last five years were analyzed. We found that the personal dose equivalent measured over a lead apron was underestimated by â¼20% to â¼40% for X-ray beam qualities used in radiology. Measurements made over five-year period confirm that the use of a single under-apron dosimeter is inadequate for personnel monitoring. Relatively high skin dose (&gt;10 mSv/month) would have remained undetected without a second dosimeter placed on the apron. },

  Abstract                 = {In this study the distribution of natural radionuclides (226Ra, 232Th, 40K) in brick and roofing tile samples commonly used as building materials in Turkey was measured by using gamma spectrometry. The activity concentrations, radium equivalent activities (Raeq), representative level index, indoor absorbed dose rate in air values and annual effective dose due to the intake of the above-mentioned radionuclides in the brick and roofing tile samples were estimated to assess the radiation hazard for people living in dwellings made of the materials studied. The measured average activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were 34Â Â±Â 14, 34Â Â±Â 13 and 462Â Â±Â 175 Bq.kgâ1, respectively, for brick samples. For roofing tile, the average activity concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K were measured to be 34Â Â±Â 14, 33Â Â±Â 12 and 429Â Â±Â 161 Bq.kgâ1, respectively. The concentrations for these natural radionuclides were compared withÂ the reported data of other countries. The Raeq values of all samples were lower than the limit of 370 Bq.kgâ1, equivalent to a gamma dose of 1.5Â mSv.aâ1 recommended by OECD. This study shows that the measured brick and roofing tile samples do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard and are safe to be used as building materials. Moreover, the experimental mass attenuation coefficients (Î¼/Ï) of brick and roofing tile samples were determined in the energy range 80â1332Â keV using the gamma ray transmission method. The experimental mass attenuation coefficients were compared with theoretical values obtained using XCOM. It was found that the computed values and the experimental results of this work are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The chemical compositions and structural analysis (XRD) of the brick and roofing tile samples are also presented. },

The normalized dose response f(D) for all energies is modeled using the Unified Interaction Model and the dependence of f(D)max on energy is interpreted as arising from strong dependence of the relative intensity of localized recombination on particle energy (ionization density). },

At 11 locations around San Salvador, terrestrial molluscs (Cerion) from the eolianites, lagoonal bivalves (Codakia), and corals from the highstand deposits were dated by ESR. Volumetrically averaged sedimentary dose rates were calculated from sedimentary geochemistry and time-averaged cosmic dose rates from each sampleâs current and past geologic contexts. Rice Bay Formation corals dated at 3.9 Â± 0.3 to 7.1 Â± 0.4 ka (OIS 1). Minimum ages for the Cockburn Town Memberâs regressive phase ranged from 49 Â± 6 to 75 Â± 8 ka, correlating with \{OIS\} 3â4. Codakia dates showed that an \{OIS\} 5a sealevel approached modern levels at 91â78 ka. In situ corals from the Cockburn Town Reef averaged from 127 Â± 6 to 138 Â± 10 ka, correlating well with \{OIS\} 5e. Ages from the Reefâs rubble zones hint that some coral reefs grew as early as \{OIS\} 7, but were likely reworked during \{OIS\} 5. San Salvador preserves deposits from three mid to late Quaternary highstands above, and as many as three that closely approach, modern sealevel. },

  Abstract                 = {Prerequisite for any new clinical dosimeter is a detailed understanding of the detectorâs dose response behavior. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the level of variability in dose response characteristics of 3Â siemens \{EPIDs\} for both 6 and 18Â MV photons. Dose response tests for linearity, field size, short- and long-term reproducibilities, ghosting effects and dose rate dependence were undertaken for three different model Siemens \{EPIDs\} on three dosimetrically matched linear accelerators. All three \{EPIDs\} showed a linear dose response above 20 monitor units. The pixel sensitivity for \{EPID2\} and \{EPID3\} agreed to within 0.5%. \{EPID1\} was 6.3% (6Â MV) and 2.3% (18Â MV) greater than for \{EPID2\} and EPID3. The field size response and dose rate response agreed within 1% for all three EPIDs. The short-term and long-term reproducibilities for all \{EPIDs\} were within 0.5% and 1% respectively. The maximum increase in relative response due to the ghosting effect was 0.5%. The off-axis profiles from uncorrected gain files agreed to within 2% for \{EPID2\} and \{EPID3\} at 6Â MV and 18Â MV respectively. The off-axis profiles for \{EPID1\} had more pronounced horns. The different dose response behavior of \{EPID1\} is due to a thicker phosphor scintillator compared to \{EPID2\} and EPID3. \{EPID1\} was significantly more sensitive to dose and energy variations and would require separate calibration data for \{EPID\} dosimetry. \{EPIDs\} with the same phosphor had no significant difference in dose response. Differences in EPID/phosphor design must be considered when commissioning \{EPIDs\} for clinical dosimetry. },

The shift in optical absorption edge in irradiated \{PVDC\} was correlated with the decrease in optical band gap energy. The distinguishable characteristic peaks were observed due to UVâVis analysis, in lithium irradiated samples of \{PVDC\} at higher fluences. The % age decrease in optical band gap energy for the respective ions were 30.9%, 34.16%, 81.1%, 87.02% respectively.

  Abstract                 = {The James M. Slater, M.D. Proton Therapy Treatment and Research Center of the Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) has treated more than 15,000 patients with proton beams since its inception in 1990, and it is responsible for the majority of patients treated with protons in a hospital setting. Moreover, it is one of only a few institutions with approval by the Federal Drug Administration to treat patients with dynamically scanned proton beams with such beams available presently for experimentation at LLUMC. These features place \{LLUMC\} in a unique position for determining improved estimates of outcomes and risks associated with proton therapy including more precise risk estimates for second cancers in patients treated with active or passive proton delivery systems An ancillary benefit in the context of establishing the risks of doses in medical applications is that it would provide a much more solid basis for the estimation of effective doses and the application of microdosimetric spectral analyses to such risk estimations. Such results are important as both the number of institutions treating with protons and the number of patients treated with protons will be increasing rapidly over the next few years. The \{LLUMC\} prostate cancer group is the largest and most homogeneously treated proton patient group at the facility and has the potential for yielding risk estimates of secondary cancers with reasonable uncertainty, as will be discussed in this presentation. The total dose and dose per fraction for all patients treated to date have a relatively restricted range from 74Â Gy to 81Â Gy. In addition, the primary treatment planning and delivery technique (opposing laterals with one field treated per day, proton energy range 225â250Â MeV) has not been changed from inception. In particular, this group represents a single-institution homogeneous cohort in terms of treatment parameters important for, for example, secondary neutron dose outside the treatment volume. The potential clinical and epidemiological benefit from such treatments has provided the impetus for the development of a comprehensive patient database. A projected accrual has been calculated based upon the current number of proton patients already being followed, their observed survival, and the censoring rate because of loss to follow-up. The analysis is presented and discussed for a patient population restricted to those treated with protons only, i.e., not including those who received combined proton and X-ray treatments. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Numerical dating methods in Quaternary science are faced with the need to adequately visualise data consisting of estimates that have differing standard errors. Recent approaches either focus on the display of age frequency distributions that ignore the standard errors or on radial plots, that support comparisons between estimates allowing for their differing precisions, but without giving an explicit picture of the age frequency distribution. Hence, visualising both aspects requires at least two plots. Here, an alternative is introduced: The abanico plot. It combines both aspects and therefore allows comprehensive presentation of chronometric data with individual standard errors. It extends the radial plot by a kernel density estimate plot, histogram or dot plot and contains elements that link both plot types. As part of the R package âLuminescenceâ (version â©¾ 0.4.5 ), the abanico plot is designed as the final part of a comprehensive analysis chain of luminescence data but is open to a wide range of other Quaternary dating communities, as illustrated by several examples. },

Dosimetric properties are analysed in order to examine and to critically evaluate the usability. Tests are carried out regarding the characterization of the radiation induced \{TL\} signal and the zero dose signal (intrinsic background) on a variety of display samples. Investigations on the thermal and optical stability of \{TL\} signals are carried out. The detection limit is mainly determined by the variability of the zero dose signal and lies in the range of 300â400Â mGy. A linear relationship between the measured \{TL\} signal and the applied dose is observed for doses between 10Â mGy and 20Â Gy. A measurement protocol for the detection of absorbed radiation dose is developed, considering the experimental dosimetric properties. A reconstruction of the absorbed dose is possible using glass samples from mobile phones, if the signal loss due to storage and optical bleaching of the \{TL\} signal is adequately corrected for. This was confirmed by realistic tests. },

  Abstract                 = {Previous studies have demonstrated that mobile phones can be used as suitable emergency dosimeters in case of an accidental radiation overexposure. Glass samples extracted from displays of mobile phones are sensitive to ionizing radiation and can be measured using the thermoluminescence (TL) method. A non-radiation induced background signal (so-called zero dose signal) was observed which overlaps with the radiation induced signal and consequently limits the minimum detectable dose. Investigations of several glasses from different displays showed that it is possible to reduce the zero dose signal up to 90% by etching the glass surface with concentrated hydrofluoric acid. With this approach a reduction of the detection limit of a factor of four, corresponding to approximately 80Â mGy, was achieved. Dosimetric properties of etched samples are presented and developed protocols validated by dose recovery tests under realistic conditions.

  Abstract                 = {Polycrystalline solid state solutions of BaySr1Â âÂ yCl2 have been produced; these adopt the cubic fluorite phase for yÂ â¤Â 0.30. The cubic structure minimizes optical scattering from grain boundaries, and so for yÂ â¤Â 0.30 the materials are transparent, a key advantage for ceramic scintillators and phosphors. The substitution of Sr2+ ions with Ba2+ ions has the advantage that it substantially increases the x-ray absorption coefficient with respect to pure SrCl2. Additional doping with rare earth ions such as Sm2+ and Eu2+ gives bright x-ray phosphor materials. The Sm or Eu-doped materials show a broad 4f55Â d1Â âÂ 4f6 emission peaked at 685Â nm or a broad 4f65Â d1Â âÂ 4f7 emission peaked at 406Â nm respectively. These materials have been tested as x-ray phosphors and the spatial resolution was determined to be at least 6Â LP/mm, whilst the x-ray radioluminescence intensity is around 40% that of the commercial x-ray phosphor Gd2O2S:Tb. A stratified phoswich structure, comprising Eu and Sm-doped layers of BaySr1Â âÂ yCl2 was produced in which the relative intensities of the two emissions varies with x-ray beam energy; this can be used for energy discrimination in imaging by way of emission spectra as opposed to the more commonly used pulse shape discrimination. A dual energy imaging technique based on these bi-layered structures and utilizing a semi-professional grade digital \{SLR\} camera is described and composition-sensitive imaging has been demonstrated. },

It has been found that when samples containing Nd3+ and Er3+ impurities are excited in specific Nd3+ bands not only Nd3+ but also Er3+ luminescence bands appear. The studies of the decay kinetics show that there is an energy transfer from Nd3+ to Er3+, moreover âgreenâ and âredâ Er3+ luminescence bands appear as result of two different energy transfer mechanisms. In addition, photoluminescence processes in Nd3+ ions are investigated. Based on the obtained experimental results luminescence and energy transfer processes in NaLaF4:Er3+, Nd3+ material are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The dose distributions at the region of eye lens and extremities of staff working in interventional cardiology were analyzed. The doses to physicians and nurses from three hospitals in Poland were measured with \{TL\} dosimeters (MCP-N) located on various places near eyebrows, on both fingers, wrists, knees and on the ankle. The procedures under investigation were coronary angiography (CA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peacemaker and defibrillator implantations (PM/ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without defibrillator implantations (CRT-D or CRT) and radiofrequency ablations (RFA). The study aimed at analyzing the distribution of radiation in selected anatomic regions, determining the typical locations of highest doses and estimating the dose ranges for selected types of procedures. The maximum registered doses per procedure to eye lens and ankle were 1.21Â mSv and 1.46Â mSv for \{CA\} \{PCI\} procedures, 0.02Â mSv and 0.05Â mSv for \{RFA\} and 0.13Â mSv and 0.51Â mSv for PM/ICDs, respectively. The maximum doses to fingers, wrists and knees were, accordingly, 2.11Â mSv, 1.07Â mSv and 0.77Â mSv for \{CA\} \{PCI\} procedures, 0.38Â mSv, 0.20Â mSv and 0.04Â mSv for \{RFA\} ones, 0.50Â mSv, 0.25Â mSv and 0.01Â mSv for PM/ICDs procedures and 2.25Â mSv, 1.12Â mSv and 0.58Â mSv for \{CRT\} and CRT-D ones. The factors which might influence the dose like utilized radiation, availability of additional protective equipment and position of the staff with respect to X-ray source were also analyzed. The annual doses for eye lens and extremities were estimated on the basis of individual annual workloads of the physicians participating in the study. The highest annual doses were revealed for physicians performing \{CA\} \{PCI\} procedures. Annual eye lens doses range up to 247Â mSv indicating that the occupational limit for eye lens 150Â mSv has been surpassed. In case of extremities the maximal estimated annual doses were 355Â mSv, 136Â mSv, 55Â mSv and 328Â mSv, for fingers, wrists, knees and for ankle, respectively. Moreover, in the light of \{ICRP\} new Statement on Tissue Reactions raising the possibility of lowering the annual limit for the lens of the eye the annual doses estimated in our paper indicate that for some procedures the monitoring of eye lens doses should be considered. On the other hand, it is important to note that most of high occupational doses can be easily avoided if radiation protection tools are used and, moreover, used properly. The present survey is a part of \{ORAMED\} project concerning the determination of doses to extremities (fingers, wrists and knees) and eye lens during interventional procedures and includes the detailed analyses of results of Polish partner. They are, however, presented in wider context. The study is additionally extended by the investigation of the dose distribution at the eyebrows and ankle level. },

  Abstract                 = {The study reports doses to eye lens and leg of physicians working in interventional radiology suites. The distributions of doses were measured and analysed in clinical conditions within the broad area from the left to the right side of the interventionalist's head at the level of eyebrows and the left ankle. These measurements were used to assay the doses to the interventionalist's eye lens and ankles. Additionally, the knee doses recorded during the \{ORAMED\} project were also reported for comparison. The measurements were performed in two interventional suites, both equipped with under-couch fluoroscopy systems with the lead curtain attached to the interventional table and ceiling shield; the latter, however, was not used. The data from a range of procedures, including embolisation (of abdominal aorta, carotids and brain), digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and angioplasty (PTA) of lower limbs (LL), carotids and brain (C/B) were recorded. The doses measured at the level of eyebrows strongly depended on the location of dosimeter. The difference between doses measured near the left and right eye lens is about 80% of the highest dose (right or left). The âbest positionâ to place the eye lens dosimeter is the side of the eye closest to the X-ray tube; however, even in that case, the doses can still be underestimated up to 18% as the location corresponding to the maximum dose may vary from procedure to procedure due to different exposure conditions. Moreover, when comparing the doses on ankle and knee level, the former ones were higher than the latter for all types of procedures. The mean ratio is 2.1 for embolisation procedures, 2.4 for DSA/PTA \{LL\} and 1.3 for DSA/PTA C/B. The mean doses to eye lens are 0.108Â mSv/procedure, 0.082Â mSv/procedure and 0.027Â mSv/procedure for embolisations, DSA/PTA \{LL\} and DSA/PTA C/B procedures, respectively, while the respective doses for the ankle are 0.047Â mSv/procedure, 0.117Â mSv/procedure and 0.042Â mSv/procedure. The highest estimated annual eye lens and lower extremity doses were 26.5Â mSv to the eye and 47.0Â mSv to the ankle. These values do not exceed the existing annual limits. However, in the light of the recent recommendations of the \{ICRP\} concerning lower occupational limit to the lens of the eye of 20Â mSv per annum, the monitoring of the eye lens seems to be very important. For one of the interventionalist included in the present study, this new limit is exceeded. },

  Abstract                 = {The \{UAB\} PADC-based neutron dosimeter consists of a 500Â Î¼m thick Poly Allyl Diglicol Carbonate layer, covered with polyethylene, to originate protons from fast neutrons through elastic (n,p) scattering, with Makrofol, to flatten the energy response of the dosimeter, especially at high neutron energies, and with Nylon, where protons of 626Â keV are produced through the 14N(n,p)14C reaction from incident thermal neutrons. Extensive work was performed in the past to characterise the Hp(10) response of this neutron dosimeter, with exposures to reference monoenergetic fields as well as to \{ISO\} radionuclide based sources. In the present work, all known information about the dosimeter response R is gathered in order to build the response curves as a function of incident neutron energy in terms of fluence, R Î¦ ( E ) , and in terms of personal dose equivalent, R H p ( 10 ) ( E ) , for normally incident neutrons. Once R Î¦ ( E ) is known, the calculated dosimeter readings when exposed to known neutron fields (SIGMA source (IRSN, Cadarache) and several \{ISO\} sources) are evaluated and compared to experimental measurements. Calculated and experimental values agree within uncertainties for the \{SIGMA\} source and the 241AmâBe and 252Cf sources, while differences about 20% appear for the \{D2O\} moderated sources, which have an important contribution of intermediate energy neutrons. An average value of 350Â cmâ2Â mSvâ1 for the coefficient K relating dosimeter reading with personal dose equivalent allows determining neutron personal equivalent doses in the range â¼200Â keVâ12Â MeV with an overall standard uncertainty below 50%, as required for routine operational neutron personal dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {Within the \{ORAMED\} project a coordinated measurement program for occupationally exposed medical staff was performed in different hospitals in Europe. The main objectives of \{ORAMED\} were to obtain a set of standardized data on doses for staff in interventional cardiology and radiology and to optimize staff protection. Doses were measured with thermoluminescent dosemeters on the ring finger and wrist of both hands, on legs and at the level of the eyes of the main operator performing interventional procedures. In this paper an overview of the doses per procedure measured during 646 interventional cardiology procedures is given for cardiac angiographies and angioplasties (CA/PTCA), radiofrequency ablations (RFA) and pacemaker and defibrillator implantations (PM/ICD). 31% of the monitored procedures were associated with no collective protective equipment, whereas 44% involved a ceiling screen and a table curtain. Although associated with the smallest air kerma â area product (KAP), PM/ICD procedures led to the highest doses. As expected, \{KAP\} and doses values exhibited a very large variability. The left side of the operator, most frequently the closest to the X-ray scattering region, was more exposed than his right side. An analysis of the effect of parameters influencing the doses, namely collective protective equipment, X-ray tube configuration and catheter access route, was performed on the doses normalized to KAP. Ceiling screen and table curtain were observed to reduce normalized doses by atmost a factor 4, much smaller than theoretical attenuation factors typical for such protections, i.e. from 10 to 100. This observation was understood as their inappropriate use by the operators and their non-optimized design. Configurations with tube above the patient led to higher normalized doses to the operator than tube below, but the effect of using a biplane X-ray suite was more complex to analyze. For CA/PTCA procedures, the upper part of the operatorâs body received higher normalized doses for radial than for femoral catheter access, by atmost a factor 5. This could be seen for cases with no collective protection. The eyes were observed to receive the maximum fraction of the annual dose limit almost as frequently as legs and hands, and clearly the most frequently, if the former 150Â mSv and new 20Â mSv recommended limits for the lens of the eye are considered, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of annealing and fuel type on the thermoluminescent (TL) properties of Li2B4O7 (LBO) synthesized by Solution Combustion Synthesis. In this study, LBO:Cu,Ag was synthesized using four fuel combinations of urea, a urea/ammonium nitrate mixture, glycine, and a glycine/ammonium nitrate mixture. Annealing was performed at temperatures from 800Â Â°C to 900Â Â°C for periods from 20Â min to 120Â min. The samples were then studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and TL. The results show that, among the parameters investigated, the annealing temperature and duration are the main parameters affecting the \{TL\} sensitivity (up to a factor of 2), which may be correlated with crystallite sizes. We also observed some effect of annealing on light sensitivity, but the effect was at most a reduction from a \{TL\} loss of â¼20% to â¼2% for 3Â h exposure to room light. The main conclusion is that Solution Combustion Synthesis is an appropriate method to obtain LBO:Cu,Ag suitable for temperature sensing applications, the post-synthesis annealing regime being one of the parameters that can affect the signal intensity and, to a lesser extent, the light sensitivity. },

The presence of Eu3+ has been confirmed by photoluminescence spectra of non-irradiated crystals, whereas the presence of Mn2+ by absorption spectra of gamma-irradiated ones, as well as by \{EPR\} measurements. Unlike in most thermoluminescence studies on pure and doped LTB, performed usually above 300Â K, glow curves have been recorded between 10 and 300Â K in order to focus the attention on shallow traps. A broad, intense glow peak is observed around 80Â K, with three weaker peaks at 205, 255, and 280Â K. Based on supplementary TmaxÂ âÂ Tstop experiments, the trap parameters have been derived assuming that the glow curve is in fact formed by a superposition of a double Gaussian band related to a quasi-continuous distribution of trapping levels, and several glow peaks produced by discrete traps. The nature of the traps is also discussed. },

It is shown that traps play an efficient role in the scintillation of LuAG:Pr, being responsible for the yield decrease and introducing a long component to the time profiles. The trap concentrations in the annealed crystals are lower than in the non-annealed ones, which correlates with the yield enhancement. },

  Abstract                 = {A wireless sensing method for the measurement of gamma radiation dose has been developed based on the fact that gamma rays can initiate the polymerization of acrylamide, which causes an increase in solution viscosity that can be detected with a wireless magnetoelastic sensor. The magnetoelastic sensor is able to wirelessly detect the resonance frequency shifts of a magnetoelastic foil in response to changes in solution viscosity. There is a linear relationship between the resonance frequency shift and gamma radiation dose in the range of 0â50 Gy (under optimal conditions) with a detection limit of 0.25 Gy. This method has the advantage of providing real-time, continuous measurement in situ. The method has been used successfully to determine the gamma radiation dose in real exposure scenarios, with satisfactory results. },

The 222Rn measurements were carried out for a complete annual cycle in the different halls: Vestibule hall from July 2003 to June 2004, Ballet hall from July 2004 to June 2005 and Mirador hall from July 2005 to June 2006. Starting from the entrance of the cave we successively find the Vestibule hall, the Ballet hall and the Mirador hall. The range of 222Rn levels were of 8â627Â BqÂ mâ3 for the Vestibule hall, 28â575Â BqÂ mâ3 for the Ballet hall and 38â578Â BqÂ mâ3 for the Mirador. The aim of this study was to detect seasonal variation patterns of 222Rn concentrations. The seasonal variations of 222Rn concentrations are discussed in relation to various meteorological factors measured inside and outside the cave. The radiation exposure levels for workers and tourists with different equilibrium factors have been evaluated. The radiation exposure levels for workers and tourists only represent a low percentage of the exposure guides for the general population. },

  Abstract                 = {Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements of quartz are widely used to measure equivalent dose (De). At radiation doses above â¼100 Gy, saturation of traps results in a decrease in the rate of growth of the \{OSL\} signal, and this makes calculation of De increasingly difficult. A series of dose recovery experiments was undertaken using single grains of quartz from Kalambo Falls, Zambia to explore saturation of single grains. When the \{OSL\} signal from many grains is averaged, the characteristic dose (D0) is 47 Gy, typical of published values for quartz. However, \{D0\} for individual grains varies from â¼10 to 100 Gy. Doses up to two times the average \{D0\} could be accurately recovered, but above this dose the De became increasingly underestimated. Overdispersion for this type of experiment should be zero, but was observed in all data sets; furthermore the value of overdispersion increased with De. An additional acceptance criterion, the Fast Ratio, is suggested for single grain \{OSL\} analysis. This criterion assesses the relative contribution of the fast component of the \{OSL\} signal. Including this as an additional acceptance criterion leads to an improved precision, with overdispersion reduced to zero, and improved accuracy in dose recovery at high doses. },

  Abstract                 = {Focussed laser systems designed to measure the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signals from individual sand sized mineral grains are now widely used. One system that is commonly used can hold up to 100 grains on a 9.8Â mm diameter aluminium disc, and can use either a green or infrared (IR) laser for optical stimulation. The grains are held in holes drilled into the disc surface, and the spacing between the edges of adjacent holes is only 300Â Î¼m. Focussing of the laser is essential to prevent inadvertent optical stimulation of adjacent grains, but no measurements have previously been made to determine the extent of cross-talk. Measurements on two systems show that the maximum cross-talk for an adjacent position is 0.22%, but typically the value is 0.04% for the green laser and 0.08% for the \{IR\} laser. This magnitude of cross-talk is unlikely to have a significant impact on continuous wave \{OSL\} measurements where the period of optical stimulation tends to be short, but may be important in linearly modulated \{OSL\} measurements where long periods of stimulation are sometimes used to characterise slow components of the \{OSL\} signal. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In recent years opercula of the snail species Bithynia tentaculata have been shown to emit thermoluminescence (TL) signals that can be used to determine equivalent dose, and may be capable of dating events throughout the entire Quaternary period. Concentric growth lines are a notable feature of almost all B. tentaculata opercula, but it is not known whether the luminescence emitted by the opercula is influenced by these structures. This study uses a newly developed \{EMCCD\} imaging system to measure the \{TL\} signals from opercula. A combination of microscopic analysis of the opercula using visible imagery, and measurement of the \{TL\} using the \{EMCCD\} system has been undertaken. Variations in \{TL\} intensity and equivalent dose (De) are seen, but the two are not correlated. Changes in \{TL\} intensity broadly mimic the concentric growth structures, but the largest variations in intensity are between different margins of the opercula, not individual growth bands. The \{EMCCD\} system makes it possible to produce a two dimensional map of the De measured from an operculum. Dose recovery experiments give De values that are consistent with each other across the whole opercula. Measurement of the De arising from irradiation in nature shows significant variability across a single operculum, but at present the reason for this variability is unknown. },

  Abstract                 = {The Australian Clinical Dosimetry Service (ACDS) is a government initiative to provide all radiation therapy centers in Australia with access to free and independent dosimetric audit services. Based out of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, the \{ACDS\} commenced audit operations in 2010. Aim The objective of this work was to commission Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dosimeters (OSLDs) as a replacement for Thermoluminescence Dosimeters (TLD) for use in the ACDS's remote auditing program, with a view to extending their application to higher level dosimetry in anthropomorphic phantoms. Materials and Method The In-Light nanoDotsâ¢ \{OSLD\} system from Landauer Inc. was commissioned using both the Australian National Linear Accelerator, an Elekta Synergy II, and an Eldorado Co-60 unit. The linearity, signal depletion, fading, energy dependence, reproducibility and resetting of nanoDotâ¢ dosimeters were determined for clinical photon and electron beams. Results NanoDotsâ¢ \{OSLDs\} demonstrate; supralinearity dependent on the overall accumulated dose. Little signal depletion per readout (0.03% per read). Reproducible fading, characterised by an initial transient signal decay over a period of 16Â min post irradiation, followed by a predictable logarithmic decay resulting in signal decrease of 3% over several months. Little dependence on energy or modality over the clinical range. Optical resetting tests show negligible change in sensitivity post reset for up to five cycles. Conclusion Modern \{OSLDs\} such as the nanoDotsâ¢ dosimeters provide a viable alternative to the established \{TLD\} technology with comparable accuracy and greater efficiency. The efficiency, reusability and accuracy of nanoDotâ¢ dosimeters makes them an ideal candidate for the large-scale dosimetry operations currently undertaken by the ACDS. },

  Abstract                 = {The signal from the fast component is usually considered preferable for quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, however its presence in a continuous wave (CW) \{OSL\} signal is often assumed, rather than verified. This paper presents an objective measure (termed the fast ratio) for testing the dominance of the fast component in the initial part of a quartz \{OSL\} signal. The ratio is based upon the photo ionisation cross-sections of the fast and medium components and the power of the measurement equipment used to record the \{OSL\} signal, and it compares parts of the \{OSL\} signal selected to represent the fast and medium components. The ability of the fast ratio to distinguish between samples whose CW-OSL signal is dominated by the fast and non-fast components is demonstrated by comparing the fast ratio with the contribution of the fast component calculated from curve deconvolution of measured \{OSL\} signals and from simulated data. The ratio offers a rapid method for screening a large number of \{OSL\} signals obtained for individual equivalent dose estimates, it can be calculated and applied as easily asÂ other routine screening methods, and is transferrable between different aliquots, samples and measurement equipment. },

The precisely determined ages of these sea level benchmarks were compared with expected relative sea level position based on glacio-hydro-isostatic modeling to assess the rate of uplift in this region. When combined with the age of various late Holocene archaeological sites that have been recently described and characterized in terms of their functional position relative to sea level these data collectively define a rate of uplift â¤0.4 mm aâ1 along this portion of the Sicilian coastline. These results are consistent with an age assignment of marine isotope stage (MIS) 5.3 or 5.5 for the Akradina terrace, which in turn places temporal constraints on paleoshorelines above and below this level. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Grain size and shape are two important parameters in Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of sediment, since they have a direct impact on several correction factors that are used for evaluating the dose rate. These parameters were evaluated by static image analysis for a wide range of quartz and feldspar grain samples. Our results indicate that there are many factors that may influence the final grain size and shape. Overall, grains are not perfect spheres, but should be rather approximated to smooth slightly elongated ellipsoids, with a width that is on average about 25% smaller than the length. For multiple grains dating, this may have an influence of a few percents on the beta dose rate evaluation, and thus even less on the total dose rate. However, in the case of single grain dating, the impact may be somewhat more significant given the large variability in size and shape between grains that may be encountered in a natural sediment. For beta micro-dosimetry purpose, it may be thus useful to better characterize the single grain that is going to be dated. },

The data obtained were compared to show the advantages and disadvantages of the two radiometric methods, determine the alpha-radioactivity concentration and the radiation dose associated with the use of the studied groundwaters. Calibration of the methods was performed by means of uranium standard solutions and the corresponding data were used to evaluate linear range, detector efficiency, detection limits, value of the information obtained, and time of analysis of the methods. Comparison of the data obtained from calibration and natural sample measurements has shown that alpha-particle counting with a simple alpha-radiometer (equipped with a semiconductor detector) may offer only an activity value and not detailed information about the isotopic composition but it is the fastest method and the method of choice if only a screening method for the alpha-radioactivity measurement is required. Based on the alpha-radioactivity data, the corresponding radiation dose was estimated for situations where the groundwaters are used for drinking water purposes. },

The aim of this study was to investigate whether retrospective dosemeters can provide dose estimates with comparable accuracy like conventional personal dosemeters. Using an external source of radiation 137Cs and an anthropomorphic phantom, we simulated serious irradiation of a human body in anterior-posterior and rotational geometries. Retrospective luminescence dosimetry objects, such as mobile phones, dental ceramic and household salt, and conventional personal dosemeters (thermoluminescent and electronic) were fixed to the anthropomorphic phantom. The doses obtained were compared with specific reference values. In most cases, relative deviations between the measured doses and the reference values did not exceed 20%. As the retrospective and conventional dosemeters show no significant differences in laboratory conditions, the retrospective luminescence dosimetry objects represent a very promising tool if handled properly. },

The ceramic is an innovative material used in dental prostheses and restorations. It is strongly sensitive to radiation and the intensity of both the \{OSL\} and \{TL\} signals are proportional to the absorbed radiation dose. We focused on the optimization of the measuring procedure and investigated characteristics such as reproducibility, fading, minimum detectable dose (MDD), dose response and photon energy response of \{TL\} and \{OSL\} signals. The dental ceramic exhibited very good reproducibility (&lt;5% at 2Ï level) when measured and a linear dose response for a wide range of doses (50Â mGyâ20Â Gy). The \{MDD\} values for the samples investigated were â¼5Â mGy. The material is not tissue equivalent and the \{OSL\} and \{TL\} signals are strongly dependent on incident photon energy. Both the luminescence signals exhibited significant fading during the first few hours after irradiation. Its rate was dependent on the parameters of measurement. The results indicate that the material can be used for the purposes of accident dosimetry, however, the fading and photon energy response have to be properly corrected for a reliable dose assessment. },

We also measure the sensitivity and background for samples from various crystal growth processes. The results confirm that the detectors can be efficiently bleached with a \{N2\} laser and the \{RPL\} signal exhibits a linear dose response using either \{UV\} or red excitation. However, red excitation yields higher background (relative to the signal after irradiation) compared to \{UV\} excitation. Using red excitation, the emission spectrum is dominated by an unknown emission centered &gt;800Â nm at low doses. The main obstacles for dosimetry application are the signal increase over time, observed after bleaching and irradiation, and the background after optical bleaching. },

The aim of this study was to investigate both the microscopic and macroscopic contributions of the absorbed dose involved in GdNCT. Methods Cylindrical containers with diameters 1â30Â mm filled with a solution of Gd were irradiated with epithermal neutrons. The background neutron dose as well as the prompt gamma dose has been calculated and measured by means of film dosimetry for the largest cylinder. Monte Carlo codes MCNP5(b) and \{GEANT4\} have been utilized for calculation the absorbed dose. Results and discussion Results from the film dosimetry are in agreement with the calculations for high doses while for low doses the measured values are higher than the calculated results. For the largest cylinder, the prompt gamma dose from GdNCR neutron is at least five times higher than the background dose. For a cell cluster model, in the first 0.1Â mm the major contribution to the absorbed dose is from \{IC\} electrons. If Gd atoms were homogeneously distributed in the nuclei of all tumour cells, capture events between neutron and Gd atoms close to \{DNA\} could kill the tumour cells and give cross-fire dose from \{IC\} electrons to the cells located in the 0.1Â mm range. Conclusions For a correct GdNCT dosimetry both microscopic part of the dose delivered by short-range low energy electrons and macroscopic part delivered by the prompt gamma should be considered. },

Having virtually zero background and exposure time, are advantages of this method. After sampling, all of the 31 samples were transferred to laboratory to place CR-39 detectors vertically in them. In next step, CR-39 detectors were etched in NaOH 6Â M, aqueous solution at 70Â Â°C for 4Â h. Then, number of tracks per area unit was counted by an optical microscope. The amounts of alpha activity were calculated in all samples and range of minimum 1.40EÂ +Â 04 to maximum 3.03EÂ +Â 05Â Bq/kg .And also the activity of Th-232 and U-238 are measured by alpha-track method. Moreover âequivalent uraniumâ (eU) and âequivalent thoriumâ (eTh) by Hp-Ge detector, were calculated. },

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the developments in nuclear track methodology as published in the proceedings of the last ten meetings of the International Conference on Nuclear Tracks in Solids (ICNTS) from the Marburg (Germany) conference in 1990 to the Bologna (Italy) conference of 2008. Nuclear Tracks Methodology (NTM) examines the effects of the interaction between charged particles and solid materials and presents several desirable characteristics: the detectors can easily be cut into a size appropriate for any application and can be used in locations for which other radiation detectors are not suitable; the etching and reading instrumentation is relatively simple; there is a quasi-insensibility to gamma radiation for reasonable dose exposures (typically &lt;1Â kGy); after chemical etching the information recorded on the detector material is essentially permanent; and, finally, the system involves relatively low costs. These characteristics have contributed to the importance of \{NTM\} for radiation detection in an immense number of applications across a wide range of scientific and technological fields. This paper reviews the new ideas, topics, materials and applications related to \{NTM\} that have been presented over the past ten \{ICNTS\} meetings from 1990 to 2008, and analyzes the evolution of various topics. One could argue that the conferences themselves have been an important source of new ideas and applications for the nuclear track research community. Two important observations arise from this review. The first is that the contributions of the past ten international conferences can be conveniently classified into 12 categories. The second is that the number of papers published varied widely from conference to conference. Several factors contributed: the variation in the number of conference participants, the interests of local participants (who account for a disproportionate number of conference participants), the location of the conference, and the appearance of new international conferences devoted to topics similar to those covered by the ICNTS. },

Nuclear Track Methodology, by using a closed-end cup device as a radon chamber is an attractive option for such large-scale indoor radon measurements. A comparative analysis of the detection efficiency of four different (one commercial and 3 specially designed) passive closed-end cup devices for the measurement of indoor radon concentrations is presented. CR-39 (LantrackÂ®) polycarbonate was the detector material. The four devices were simultaneously exposed to a mean radon concentration of 860Â Â±Â 60Â BqÂ mâ3 inside a closed room for periods of one, two and three months. An AlphaGUARDÂ® radon monitoring system was used to continuously monitor the radon concentration within the room. The chemical etching and reading procedures were carried out following a well-established protocol for indoor radon surveys. The detection efficiency and the exposure-time-response relationship of each of the devices were determined. },

The results show conspicuous one-year cyclicity with increases during the winter-fall (dry season), varying from 3.9 to 14.1% compared to summer (wet season). \{TLD\} stations installed at beach sand terrains presented elevated coefficient of variation compared to results at soils and rocky terrains. This difference was attributed tentatively to changes in naturally occurring radionuclides activity concentrations in accordance with coastal sedimentary dynamics. Additionally, long-term \{TLD\} databases, selected from main geological domains, allowed the modeling of regional absorbed dose rates. },

The scanner operates in transparency mode and the nuclear tracks on both sides of the detector are assessed. Earlier testing has revealed inconsistencies in the results obtained by the system. It was found that dust spots, artefacts or other plaque damage within the area of interest are likely to be the cause of such problems. Quality control checks and procedures have been implemented to identify and correct for these problems. Following calibration and validation against the current manual counting method, the system will be suitable to implement for routine use. },

Severe age underestimation was observed by applying the single-aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) dating method when compared with the isochron infrared stimulated luminescence (iIRSL) dating results using potassium-rich feldspar grains of different grain sizes. Preheating plateau and dose recovery tests suggest that the \{SAR\} protocol is robust for this sample. Component resolving indicates that the \{OSL\} signals were dominated by the fast component. However, the fast component is thermally unstable as shown by pulse-annealing measurements and single-grain study. This leads to \{OSL\} age underestimation. To overcome this problem, a method was proposed by combining equivalent dose (De) determination and pulse-annealing experiments using single-grain measurements to select only those grains with the thermally stable signals. For those quartz grains with thermally stable \{OSL\} signals, the ages obtained are consistent with iIRSL results. },

Concentration of Ag+ was 2 mol%. Defect centers induced by gamma rays of three base glasses were detected by Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical absorption spectra. Three kinds of defect centers were observed and the characteristics of the hyperfine splitting doublets were quite similar in these glass samples. All the defect centers are phosphorus and oxygen related radiation-induced hole trapped defect centers (POHC) and electron centers PO32â and PO44â. Based on \{EPR\} and optical absorption spectra, polyphosphate glasses have the highest relative \{POHC\} concentration. The fluorescence spectra and \{EPR\} spectra of silver-doped glasses were measured. The results indicate that polyphosphate glasses have the highest sensitivity and shortest build-up time of three silver-doped phosphate glasses which are related to the concentration of POHC. },

  Abstract                 = {InÂ vivo measurements are commonly used to determine the incorporated activity of radionuclides. However, for complex or old contaminations, the assessment of the activity distribution among organs is difficult to obtain from measurements only. A method is suggested to assess the activity of organs; it consists in separating the contribution of each contaminated organ in the experimental counts using organ-specific counting efficiencies. The feasibility of the method was first experimentally investigated using two torso phantoms containing radioactive organs. The first phantom contained two radioactive lungs and the second one two lungs and a liver. In the two cases the activity distribution was obtained using experimental specific efficiencies and the bias when compared with true activity was below 5%. The experiments were reproduced by Monte Carlo calculations in order to test the efficiency of the separation method with calculated organ-specific counting efficiencies instead of experimental ones. For the first experiment, the most contributing organ-specific counting efficiencies were correctly simulated but biases as large as 70% were found for the less contributing ones. Consequently, for one organ the activity was correctly assessed but for the other a 20% underestimate was found. For the second experiment, the calculated efficiencies were in better agreement with experimental values and the maximal difference between the calculated and the reference activity was 11%. The method's limits were investigated using perturbation point sources and considering wrong activity distribution hypothesis. The method gives correct results when the number of contaminated organs is overestimated by the startup hypothesis. The opposite situation can be identified only if more measurements than required by the startup hypothesis are carried out. },

The doses delivered to the individual samples were unknown to the participants, who were asked to measure each sample nine times, and to report the \{EPR\} signal response, the mass of aliquots measured, and the parameters of \{EPR\} signal acquisition and signal evaluation. Critical dose and detection limit were calculated by the organizers on the basis of the calibration-curve parameters obtained at every laboratory. For calibration curves obtained by measuring every calibration sample three times, the mean value of the detection limit was 205Â mGy, ranging from 56 to 649Â mGy. The participants were also invited to provide the signal response and the nominal dose of their current dose calibration curve (wherever available), the critical dose and detection limit of which were also calculated by the organizers. },

  Abstract                 = {With improvements in methodology and instrumentation, luminescence dating is becoming a much more useful chronometric tool in archaeology. Procedures for dating ceramics are relatively routine and their accuracy has been demonstrated in a number of studies. Research is aimed at applying ceramic dating in situations where other methods lack the direct dating ability of luminescence to resolve chronological problems. Sediment dating is more difficult because of uncertainty in the extent of zeroing or because of mixtures of different aged deposits. These problems have been addressed by isolating signals most likely to be zeroed and by dating single aliquots, and ultimately single grains. Single-grain dating now has the potential not only to identify and date mixed deposits but to provide valuable information on site formation processes. This is particularly critical for judging site integrity at controversial sites.},

Comparison of fading rates between pulsed and non-pulsed signals, the latter also obtained with a preceding \{IR\} exposure, shows that fading is significant for mainly the non-pulsed signals. Presence of a pulsed \{IRSL\} and the magnitudes of b-value to correct for lower alpha efficiency suggest that pulsing does not fully remove a significant feldspar signal, only a fading component. Comparison with ages of quartz extracts shows that pulsed \{OSL\} ages are consistent, while CW-OSL ages are slightly older and CW-IRSL ages are much older. The older ages suggest a less well-bleached feldspar component. },

For the fixed source-detector geometry of this study, the energy-efficiency line is: lgÉÎ³Â =Â â0.9503lgEÎ³Â +Â 0.5224. This simple approach is promising to be used to determine the radioactivities of all the nuclides which emit Î³ ray(s) with the energy (energies) between 200 and 2000Â keV in the absence of efficiency calibration standard.

The obtained powders crystallize in the monoclinic phase of LaPO4. The spectroscopic study at room temperature (RT) of the Yb3+-doped LaPO4 powder was investigated. Thus a wide band, characteristic of the fundamental 2F5/2â2F7/2 transition in near infrared (NIR) range, has been located for La(1âx)YbxPO4 (xÂ =Â 5, 10%). Four Stark levels of the ground 2F7/2 state are located on the emission spectra between 976Â nm and 1030Â nm, after excitation at 925Â nm. Low re-absorption of the 0-phonon transition was registered. Charge transfer band (CTB) luminescence ofÂ Yb3+, which is not observed in LaPO4 in later works, was appeared under 266Â nm excitation. In the UVâVisible spectra, double band typical for the \{CTB\} luminescence of Yb3+ are observed. The decay time dependence as a function of the concentration is also reported and compared to other works. The room temperature radiative lifetimes of the \{IR\} emission and charge transfer band luminescence are compatible with potential applications of this phosphor respectively as solid-state lasers and scintillators. },

During the project a wide campaign of measurements was performed in the nuclear medicine departments of the collaborating hospitals. Such data were intrinsically characterized by a large variability that depended on the procedure, the employed techniques and the operatorâs habits. That variability could easily hide some important parameter, for example, the effectiveness of the adopted shielding (for syringe and vial) or the effect of the distances from the source. This information is necessary for a valuable optimization purpose of radiation protection. To this end a sensitivity analysis was carried out through Monte Carlo simulations employing voxel models, representing operatorâs hand during the considered practices. Such analysis allowed understanding at what extent the range of personal dose equivalent evaluated during measurements can be considered intrinsically related to the procedures. Furthermore, with the Monte Carlo simulations it was possible to study the appropriateness of the shielding usually utilized in these practices. },

  Abstract                 = {Background To prepare for a possible major radiation disaster involving large numbers of potentially exposed people, it is important to be able to rapidly and accurately triage people for treatment or not, factoring in the likely conditions and available resources. To date, planners have had to create guidelines for triage based on methods for estimating dose that are clinically available and which use evidence extrapolated from unrelated conditions. Current guidelines consequently focus on measuring clinical symptoms (e.g., time-to-vomiting), which may not be subject to the same verification of standard methods and validation processes required for governmental approval processes of new and modified procedures. Biodosimeters under development have not yet been formally approved for this use. Neither set of methods has been tested in settings involving large-scale populations at risk for exposure. Objective To propose a framework for comparative evaluation of methods for such triage and to evaluate biodosimetric methods that are currently recommended and new methods as they are developed. Methods We adapt the \{NIH\} model of scientific evaluations and sciences needed for effective translational research to apply to biodosimetry for triaging very large populations following a radiation event. We detail criteria for translating basic science about dosimetry into effective multi-stage triage of large populations and illustrate it by analyzing 3 current guidelines and 3 advanced methods for biodosimetry. Conclusions This framework for evaluating dosimetry in large populations is a useful technique to compare the strengths and weaknesses of different dosimetry methods. It can help policy-makers and planners not only to compare the methodsâ strengths and weaknesses for their intended use but also to develop an integrated approach to maximize their effectiveness. It also reveals weaknesses in methods that would benefit from further research and evaluation. },

The post-collapse flows have exposure ages ranging from 62 to 11 ka. The analysis of multiple flow tops on each lava flows, often at different elevations, provides an internal check for age consistency and the exposures ages conform with stratigraphic level. The exposure ages suggest that volcanic activity along the western branch of the triple-armed rift zone was more or less continuous from before 62 ka to approximately 11 ka. The absence of magmatic activity for the last 11 kyr reflects a structural reconfiguration of the volcano and may be related to renewed flank instability. This volcanic hiatus is similar in duration to that observed in the Canary Islands. Replicate 3He exposure ages of a pre-collapse flow (123.0 Â± 5.2 ka) brackets the time of the Monte Amarelo collapse between 62 ka and 123 ka. Reproducible cosmogenic 3He exposure ages of less than 123 ka from flows away from major erosion features demonstrates that the technique is a viable alternative to the radiocarbon, K/Ar and 40Ar/39Ar chronometers for dating recent volcanism in arid climate zones. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Interest in the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of rock surfaces has increased significantly over the last few years, as the potential of the method has been explored. It has been realized that luminescence-depth profiles show qualitative evidence for multiple daylight exposure and burial events. To quantify both burial and exposure events a new mathematical model is developed by expanding the existing models of evolution of luminescenceâdepth profiles, to include repeated sequential events of burial and exposure to daylight. This new model is applied to an infrared stimulated luminescence-depth profile from a feldspar-rich granite cobble from an archaeological site near Aarhus, Denmark. This profile shows qualitative evidence for multiple daylight exposure and burial events; these are quantified using the model developed here. By determining the burial ages from the surface layer of the cobble and by fitting the new model to the luminescence profile, it is concluded that the cobble was well bleached before burial. This indicates that the \{OSL\} burial age is likely to be reliable. In addition, a recent known exposure event provides an approximate calibration for older daylight exposure events. This study confirms the suggestion that rock surfaces contain a record of exposure and burial history, and that these events can be quantified. The burial age of rock surfaces can thus be dated with confidence, based on a knowledge of their pre-burial light exposure; it may also be possible to determine the length of a fossil exposure, using a known natural light exposure as calibration. },

However, unlike classical luminescence measurements, the IR-RF signal is totally resetting when its highest value is reached. Previous studies (Buylaert etÂ al., 2012; Trautmann etÂ al., 2000) reported that the proper bleaching level of an IR-RF signal is difficult to define and seems to be dependent 1) on the wavelength used for bleaching and 2) on exposure duration. The IR-RF signals from K-feldspar samples have been measured with various bleaching wavelengths and exposure time using a Lexsyg research luminescence unit. In this study, we propose suitable bleaching parameters adapted to IR-RF measurements. },

  Abstract                 = {Various optically stimulated luminescence signals from K-feldspar have been used to determine the equivalent doses of sediment samples. Understanding the properties of these optical signals is critical to evaluate their applicability and limitations to optical dating. In this paper, some properties of IRSL, post-IR \{OSL\} and post-IR \{IRSL\} signals (detected in the \{UV\} region using U-340 filters) from a museum sample of K-feldspar were investigated by analyzing the relationships between optical and \{TL\} signals, and the effect of optical bleaching and heating on optical signals. The trap parameters of the different optical signals were calculated using the pulse annealing method. The results show that this sample exhibits two regenerated \{TL\} peaks at â¼140 and â¼330Â Â°C. Corresponding to the low temperature \{TL\} peak, the \{OSL\} and post-IR \{OSL\} signals appear to be more associated with lower temperature \{TL\} than the \{IRSL\} signal measured at 50Â Â°C. Corresponding to the high temperature \{TL\} peak, the post-IR \{IRSL\} signals mainly originate from the more thermally stable traps associated with the high temperature TL, compared with the \{IRSL\} and post-IR \{OSL\} signals. However, the post-IR IRSL225Â Â°C signal is shown to be hard to be bleached by blue light and simulated sunlight, compared with the IRSL50Â Â°C and low temperature post-IR \{IRSL\} signals. The implication for optical dating is that the elevated temperature post-IR \{IRSL\} signals can be preferentially applied over other signals from K-feldspar, but it is desirable that the effectiveness of the pre-depositional zeroing of these signals is assessed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Li6Y(BO3)3:Ce crystal is a promising type of scintillator for neutron detection. In this study, the properties of Li6Y(BO3)3:3at%Ce are studied, including its Î³ sensitivity, neutron efficiency, Î±/Î³ ratio, relative light yield, neutron pulse-height spectrum and decay time. Geant4 simulations indicate that its capture efficiency for thermal neutrons is as high as 78% for the natural abundances of the boron and lithium elements. The Î±/Î³ ratio of Li6Y(BO3)3:Ce is measured to be 0.03, which is 10 times lower than that of lithium glass. If the per-MeV light yield of lithium glass is defined to be 100, then the light yields generated by Li6Y(BO3)3:Ce for Î³ rays and Î± particles are 253.3 and 24.8, respectively. Under Î³-ray irradiation, the light yield of Li6Y(BO3)3:Ce is approximately 6 times lower than that of NaI:Tl. In neutron detection, the neutron signal can be clearly distinguished from the backgrounds caused by the 252Cf source itself. Li6Y(BO3)3:Ce is also a fast scintillator, with decay times of 48.6Â Â±Â 14.4 ns, 24.6Â Â±Â 13.3 ns and 37.8Â Â±Â 17.8 ns under irradiation with Î³ rays, Î± particles and thermal neutrons, respectively. This study offers a systematic study of useful parameters of Li6Y(BO3)3:3at%Ce crystal for application in and the improvement of neutron detection. },

  Abstract                 = {Raised beach sand deposits along the southeastern coast of Norway were dated by optical (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and the quartz and K-feldspar luminescence characteristics were described. Due to the poor quartz luminescence characteristics, only a limited number of samples were suitable for \{OSL\} dating. More promising are the K-feldspar extracts, with typical K-feldspar luminescence characteristics and no sign of fading. For equivalent dose (De) determination, sand-size quartz and feldspar extracts were used, applying a single aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocol. Both, \{OSL\} and \{IRSL\} De estimates show a wide distribution, unexpected for beach deposits. The calculated \{OSL\} and \{IRSL\} age estimates were generally in good agreement and the correctness of the ages was confirmed by independentÂ age control. Because only a limited number of the quartz samples were suitable for \{OSL\} dating, \{IRSL\} dating of the K-feldspar represents an alternative to \{OSL\} quartz dating. },

The decay time and fluorescence quantum efficiency (QE) were determined to be about 475 ns and 60%, respectively. When alpha-ray excited the crystal, both Eu2+ 4f65d-4f7(8S7/2) and Eu3+ 4f6-4f6 (5D0-7F1,2) emission peaks were observed at 435Â nm and 600Â nm. By the pulse height spectra, the relative scintillation light yield of the crystal was about 4% compared with that of \{BGO\} commercial scintillator. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation-induced luminescence dosimetry was developed using combined thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements from natural quartz in Japanese soil. \{TL\} emissions from the quartz grains were observed at â¼350â450Â nm (ultravioletâviolet TL; UVTL) and 630Â nm (red TL; RTL) using a \{TL\} spectrometer system. The \{UVTL\} glowcurve was measured for an irradiated sample, which exhibited five peaks: at 80, 110, 130, 200 and 270Â Â°C. On the other hand, the \{UVTL\} glowcurve was also measured for an as-received sample, which showed no peaks in any range of heating temperature. In the irradiated \{UVTL\} glowcurves, the integrated \{UVTL\} intensity at each peak temperature was proportional to the irradiation dose except for the 80Â Â°C peak. The TL-OSL protocol was used in a recovery test for determining the irradiation dose of a sample using thermal treatment for \{TL\} measurement instead of preheat treatment before \{OSL\} measurement. In the test, the doses measured by the \{UVTL\} peak at 200Â Â°C agreed well with the given dose and the doses measured by \{OSL\} were 80% of the given dose at an interval of 120Â h between dose delivery and dose measurement. From these results, we concluded that TL-OSL dosimetry is suitable for accident evaluation although further research is required to improve the protocol. },

  Abstract                 = {Quartz extracted from heated bricks has been previously suggested for use in dose estimation in accident dosimetry, but this technique has never been applied before to Japanese quartz which often has unusual \{OSL\} characteristics. In this study the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) characteristics of quartz extracted from a Japanese commercial red brick produced by Mishima â Renga â Seizoujyo Co. are studied. These companies are based in the Aichi Prefecture (capital Nagoya), which accounts for about half of the red brick production in Japan. A comparison of \{TL\} (thermoluminescence) and \{OSL\} signals has been carried out towards identification of common source traps. It is observed that \{OSL\} from Japanese brick quartz shows unusual luminescence characteristics; in particular, the initial fast decaying \{OSL\} signal contains a dominant (&gt;90%) thermally unstable component related to the 85 Â°C \{TL\} peak, which necessitates a prior heat treatment. A single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) protocol is developed and tested using thermal treatments intended to isolate a stable dosimetric signal. A minimum detection limit of â¼65 mGy is then estimated using this protocol. Following irradiation using 60Co and 137Cs, doseâdepth profiles were measured on two different commercial brick types (Mishima â Renga â Seizoujyo Co. and Hase â Renga Co.) with 5 Gy and 10 Gy surface doses. The profiles derived from the two sources were readily distinguishable. It is concluded that the \{OSL\} signals from the two types of Japanese brick quartz examined here can be used to derive precise estimates of accident dose, and, possibly to distinguish between sources of gamma radiation in a nuclear accident. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the existence of an unstable fast decaying \{OSL\} signal in quartz derived from bricks, and demonstrates a way forward with such samples in retrospective dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the criteria behind the selection of neutron detection techniques for photoneutron dosimetry as well as the methods adopted to obtain dosimetric readouts. The work was conducted within the framework of Working Group 9 (WG9 Radiation Protection Dosimetry in Medicine), coordinated by the European Radiation Dosimetry Group (EURADOS). \{WG9\} research aims at estimating the risk of second cancer induction due to radiation therapy. Therefore, a comprehensive experimental programme was devised to measure doses received by non-target organs-at-risk (OAR) during radiation therapy. The techniques described in this work were selected and used for the neutron dosimetric assessment during in-phantom simulations of clinical prostate radiotherapy treatments, carried out in three European facilities. Non-conformal standard fields were used as a common reference between different facilities. Performing neutron measurements near linacs is a complex task, because of the intense pulsed photon primary field. Therefore, photon insensitive dosimeters such as superheated emulsions (SE) and solid state nuclear track detectors (SSNTD) were chosen. Their readout procedures were carefully assessed. Methods were developed to count the large number of tracks and bubbles in SE. These are described in detail in the present work, along with a brief introduction to the detector physics. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents in-phantom photoneutron equivalent doses induced by external radiotherapy, these are necessary to assess organ-averaged equivalent doses to derive the risk of secondary cancer development, associated with non-target organ exposures. The measurements were performed by Working Group 9 âRadiation Protection Dosimetry in Medicineâ of the European Radiation Dosimetry Group (EURADOS) for simulations of clinical radiotherapy treatments of prostate cancer. The photoneutron dose measurements were carried out in a BOMAB-like water-filled phantom, by means of superheated emulsions (superheated drop detectors \{SDD\} and bubble damage BTIÂ® detectors) and Poly-Allyl-Diglicol-Carbonate (PADC) solid state nuclear track detectors. Dose data were acquired in a three-dimensional matrix of reproducible measurement points, which are spaced according to detectors size. Four clinical protocols for the treatment of the prostate tumor were considered and compared, by measuring the doses delivered to the planning target volume (PTV) and to peripheral radiosensitive regions (i.e. colon-rectum and bladder). The clinical irradiations were performed in two clinical radiotherapy facilities based on Varian Clinac 2300 \{CD\} accelerator: Santa Chiara University Hospital (Pisa, Italy) and Centre of Oncology M. SkÅodowska-Curie Memorial Institute (Krakow, Poland). An additional tomotherapy prostate cancer treatment was also simulated in Campo di Marte Hospital (Lucca, Italy). Radiation qualities of 6, 12, 15, 18 and 20Â MV were used; all of these are capable of producing photoneutrons. Data from this work span most of the X-ray beam energies and prostate treatment modalities used in the current clinical practice. These data permit the assessment of doses absorbed by a radiotherapy patient either at the treatment volume or at out-of-field organs. Comparison of different dosimeters, under the same irradiation conditions, showed that dosimeters generally agreed within their 20% 1 \{SD\} uncertainty. Comparison of different treatment modalities in the two contributing clinical centers (Pisa and Krakow) were also possible, as well as a comparison of dose profiles resulting from the different treatment techniques, delivered at the same primary photon energy. It was in particular found that photon acceleration energies as low as 6Â MV are able to produce a non-negligible photoneutron component, which causes an undue dose to the patient of the order of tens microsievert per unit photon dose delivered at the target volume. },

The lifetimes of the 210Â°C \{TL\} peak calculated for samples collected from thermally isolated excavations and exposed buildings are found to be clusted around 8000â10000 and 600â800 years, respectively. The results proved that 210Â°C \{TL\} peak could be used for dating of samples younger than 1000 years without thermal correction if the samples are thermally isolated from their environment. \{TL\} ages are obtained using quartz, polyminerals from brick pieces as well as flint splinters, and other quartz inclusions extracted from the mortar of the terrazzo floor of the monastery church. The measured \{TL\} ages and the consistency of the results are discussed. The fine grains in the mortar, which contained calcite/aragonite, could not be dated using thermoluminescence due to presence of a very strong non-radiation induced \{TL\} glow. },

  Abstract                 = {In an attempt to make the inÂ vitro electron spin resonance (ESR) retrospective dosimetry of the tooth enamel a lesser invasive method, experiments using X-Band and K-Band were performed, aiming to determine conditions that could be used in cases of accidental exposures. First, a small prism from the enamel was removed and ground with an agate mortar and pestle until particles reach a diameter of approximately less than 0.5Â mm. This enamel extraction process resulted in lower signal artifact compared with the direct enamel extraction performed with a diamond burr abrasion. The manual grinding of the enamel does not lead to any induced \{ESR\} signal artifact, whereas the use of a diamond burr at low speed produces a signal artifact equivalent to the dosimetric signal induced by a dose of 500Â mGy of gamma irradiation. A mass of 25Â mg of enamel was removed from a sound molar tooth previously irradiated inÂ vitro with a dose of 100Â mGy. This amount of enamel was enough to detect the dosimetric signal in a standard X-Band spectrometer. However using a K-Band spectrometer, samples mass between 5 and 10Â mg were sufficient to obtain the same sensitivity. An overall evaluation of the uncertainties involved in the process in this and other dosimetric assessments performed at our laboratory indicates that it is possible at K-Band to estimate a 100Â mGy dose with 25% accuracy. In addition, the use of K-Band also presented higher sensitivity and allowed the use of smaller sample mass in comparison with X-Band. Finally, the restoration process performed on a tooth after extraction of the 25Â mg of enamel is described. This was conducted by dental treatment using photopolymerizable resin which enabled complete recovery of the tooth from the functional and aesthetic viewpoint showing that this procedure can be minimally invasive. },

The Mn2+ \{PL\} lifetimes are nearly independent of Mn2+ concentration but the \{RL\} spectra increases at high doses for 1% Mn2+ and decreases slightly at high doses for 5% Mn2+. The 5% Mn2+ is more radiation hard and the integrated \{RL\} intensity only starts to significantly decrease above 1Â kGy. The Eu doped sample displays a \{PL\} lifetime that is lower for high Eu concentrations and this can be accounted for by a model where there is energy transfer between Eu3+ and more nonradiative decay sites at the surface. The \{RL\} is independent of dose between 10Â mGy and â¼200Â Gy, where the 1% Eu sample is more radiation hard and the Eu3+ \{RL\} intensity has decreased by only 3.4% at 6.7Â kGy. },

Recent results gave evidence that the dosimetric properties of mosaic glass depend on the presence of microcrystals in the glass network. For the samples analyzed in the present study, taking into account their chemical composition and presence and type of crystalline inclusions, it was observed that those opacified with tin-based additives (in particular, cassiterite, tin dioxide) showed higher luminescence sensitivity, being therefore more suitable for dating applications. The correlation between the presence of cassiterite and the possibility of successfully evaluating the equivalent dose has been investigated. },

  Abstract                 = {Standard calibration protocols in radiotherapy (AAPM TG-51 and \{IAEA\} \{TRS\} 398) recommend a 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 irradiation field at a distance of 100Â cm. However, the specific geometry of the Cyberknife machine enables only circular radiation beams with a maximum diameter of 6Â cm field size at a distance of 80Â cm from the source which prevents from a direct use of these protocols. Thereby, specific calibration and verification protocols are required. Within this framework, the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel and the Centre Oscar-Lambret decided to study two points of interest: i) the feasibility of the calibration of the Cyberknife beam; ii)Â the verification of the delivered dose during a treatment with a very small diameter beam using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)/alanine dosimetry. Alanine dosimeters are suitable for this work thanks to their small size, their integrating capability, and their low energy dependence as a function of both dose rate and beam energy in the radiotherapy dose range. The results of the dose rate calibration using EPR/alanine are very good, their deviations compared to the dose rate measured in the Cyberknife reference conditions are small (about 0.5%). The doses delivered during a treatment, measured within a 2% standard uncertainty, showed less than 4% deviation from the doses calculated by the treatment planning system. So, a rather good agreement is found between the measured and theoretically delivered doses. Nevertheless, the smaller the collimator diameter is, the larger the deviation is. This problem could be due to the evaluation of the output factor correction which is difficult to achieve for such small fields or to the Treatment Planning System algorithm itself and in particular the profile modelling. },

Inside the therapy room and the adjacent radiography room, gold foils were used in the center of the moderating polyethylene (PE) spheres of the spectrometer, to detect the moderated neutrons. The measured neutron spectra are dominated â as expected â by neutrons with an energy of about 1Â MeV. The spectra were in quantitative agreement with those calculated by means of the \{MCNP\} code, by Breitkreutz and co-workers. Outside the therapy room, 3He proportional counters were used to detect the neutrons moderated by the \{PE\} spheres of the spectrometer. Here, the spectra were much softer and included thermal neutrons as major component. Based on these neutron spectra, the neutron ambient dose equivalent rate H Ë â ( 10 ) was calculated. The resulting H Ë â ( 10 ) values were between 0.92 and 1.68Â Î¼Sv/h, depending on the position outside the shielding. These values were in close agreement to the one measured by means of the \{AMIRA\} tissue-equivalent proportional counter.

The light output behavior of CsI(Tl) was found to exhibit a different trend than those observed by NaI(Tl) and LaBr3(Ce), explained by shifts in the photoluminescence wavelengths with increased applied pressure. Scintillation decay times were also observed to shorten with pressure. The observed trends in light output and decay times are explained and compared to estimations by analytical models. },

  Abstract                 = {This work presents a determination of the photon energy response of Al2O3:C optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) detectors (single crystals and LuxelÂ® detectors) to photons with mean energies from 10Â keV to 1225Â keV. Irradiations were performed free-in-air using standard X-ray fields (narrow-spectrum series) specified by the International Organization for Standardization. The \{OSL\} readouts were conducted under different conditions (e.g., different optical filters; continuous or pulsed stimulation) and the analyses were performed using the initial \{OSL\} intensity or total \{OSL\} area. The measured photon energy response of the \{OSL\} signal was compared to the ratio between the massâenergy absorption coefficient for Al2O3:C and air. The results demonstrate that the photon energy response of Al2O3:C is not only dependent on the energy deposited, but also on the experimental conditions. This is attributed to the effect of ionization density on the \{OSL\} properties of Al2O3:C, which affects the shape of the \{OSL\} curve and the relative intensity of the \{OSL\} emission bands. The results highlight the importance of maintaining similar \{OSL\} readout conditions and using similar types of detectors when determining and applying photon energy correction factors. },

ZnO:Ga(La) was synthesized via photo induced precipitation from aqueous solution containing zinc formate, hydrogen peroxide and gallium nitrate or lanthanum acetate.

Resulting material features intensive excitonic luminescence under X-ray excitation, with distinct maximum at â¼392Â nm. No defect related luminescence in visible spectral range was observed. Nanocomposite material was then prepared as follows: ZnO:Ga(La) nanopowder was homogeneously dispersed in the solution of urethane dimethacrylate monomers, and the fast UV-induced polymerization was subsequently employed for preparation of optically transparent polyurethane matrix with embedded nanopowder. Radioluminescence properties of prepared nanocomposite are qualitatively similar to those of ZnO:Ga(La) nanopowder. },

The best position for an eye lens dosimeter was found to be at the side of the head nearest to the radiation source, close to the eye. Positioning the dosimeter at the eyebrow could lead to an underestimation of the lens dose of as much as 45%. The measured dose distribution showed that the absorbed dose to the eye lenses was high compared to the other parts of the head, which stresses the importance of wearing protective eyewear. However, many models of eyewear were found to be deficient as the radiation could slip through at several places, e.g. at the cheek. The relationship between the absorbed dose to the lens and the kerma-area-product (PKA) delivered to the patient was also studied. },

In 2002, an experimental device based on the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) was developed for research. It works with AL2O3:C detectors (TLD-500 &amp; Luxelâ¢) stimulated with a green line generated by a 150Â mW Ar+ laser. Since 2008, modular \{OSL\} devices have been developed using light emitting diodes (LED) and working with reflection or transmission mode. This paper describes these modules. The characteristics of the different systems are compared on experimental results: detections limits, linearity, sensitivity. The modular device presents advantages in terms of measurement possibilities with respect to the laser device: a small number of modules allows the use of different detection materials (AL2O3:C, BeO, quartz, electronic components) and different measurement methods (TL, CW-OSL and pulsed OSL). The modules are controlled by a personal computer and a microcontroller array. The whole set is able to measure a wide range of doses by changing the number of \{LEDs\} and is able to work in situ. The future trends are commented as well as some applications. },

  Abstract                 = {This work presents a unified numerical model for detailed description of the measurement of activity concentrations of radioactive noble gases by absorption in polycarbonates and external beta-counting. The model combines the numerical description of the kinetics of sorption and desorption processes with Monte Carlo simulations and calculates the measurement efficiency. The numerical model is compared to experimental data for 85Kr and 222Rn and a very good agreement is found. The numerical and experimental results show that for plate polycarbonates the measurement efficiency depends on the sorption and desorption times. In the case of 85Kr measurements the numerical modelling shows that this dependence is pronounced for thick polycarbonates and short exposure durations. For large exposure times 85Kr concentration inside the polycarbonate reaches homogeneous distribution, hence the efficiency of the system stays constant with time. In the case of 222Rn measurements no homogeneous activity distribution inside the polycarbonate can be reached due to the short half-life of 222Rn. The measurement efficiency in the case of 222Rn depends slightly on the desorption time. It is also demonstrated that in the case of 222Rn the measurement efficiency could be influenced by registration of the alpha-particles of 222Rn and its progeny. This influence increases the time dependence of the efficiency on the sorption and desorption times. Therefore, this effect must always be checked for and taken into account if an accurate measurement result is necessary. The developed numerical model allows to optimize the measurements by choosing appropriate experimental conditions in terms of polycarbonate thickness and sorption and desorption times. Results from several scenarios are presented, which allow the experimenter to chose a priori the optimal exposure and measurement conditions. Finally, we present results from pilot experiments on slowing down the desorption of the radioactive noble gases from the polycarbonates. We demonstrate that cooling the exposed polycarbonates to liquid nitrogen temperature practically stops the desorption of 222Rn from the polycarbonate specimen. },

  Abstract                 = {High- and intermediate-energy protons are not able to directly form a track in a CR-39 etch detector (TED). Such detectors, however, can be used for the detection and dosimetry of the beams of these particles through the registration of secondary charged particles with sufficiently high values of linear energy transfer (LET). High-energy protons (72â220Â MeV) and Intermediate-energy protons (10â30Â MeV) with low \{LET\} values ranging from 1.1 down to 0.4Â keV/Î¼m and 5.87 down to 2.40Â keV/Î¼m, respectively are considered in this study. It seems to be sufficient to create secondary particles, although the \{LET\} values are low. This phenomenon can modify the characteristics of the energy transfer process due to these particles, which should be taken into account when such particles are used for radiobiology studies or for radiotherapy. The importance of these secondary particles was investigated experimentally by means of an \{LET\} spectrometer based on a chemically etched track detector in which the tracks of the primary protons are not revealed. Experiments were performed with proton beams available at the Nuclear Research Center for Agriculture and Medicine (NRCAM) in Karaj, Iran and at the National Cancer Center (NCC) in Seoul, Korea with protons of primary energies of about 10â30Â MeV and 72â220Â MeV respectively. The contribution of the secondary particle dose increases as the proton energy decreases. The origin of the secondary particles in interactions with protons having high and intermediate energies due to various nuclear reactions was calculated by the both \{ALICE\} and \{TALYS\} computer codes. The secondary microdosimetry doses were also calculated by \{GEANT4\} code. There is large discrepancy between experimental and calculated results in low proton energies. It has been verified that there is a good correlation between the experimentally obtained results and the reaction cross sections predicted by \{ALICE\} and \{TALYS\} codes. },

Number of room produced photoneutrons per Gray of X-ray at the isocenter was determined for different types of concrete and named as âQWâ. This new factor was inserted in the used formula for photoneutron fluence calculations at the inner entrance of maze. The photoneutron fluence was calculated using new proposed formula at the inner entrance of maze for all studied concretes. The difference between conventional and proposed equations varied from 11% to 46% for studied concretes. It was found that room produced photoneutrons could be significant for high density concretes. Additionally, applying the new proposed formula can consider the effect of wall material composition on the photoneutron production in high energy radiation therapy rooms. Further studies to confirm the accuracy of newly developed method is recommended. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract High-temperature emission spectra of LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP-N) \{TL\} detectors, irradiated above the nominal saturation level, up to the hundreds of kGy, have been measured. Emission spectra integrated over the whole temperature range, as well as the spectra recorded at the temperatures corresponding to the \{TL\} peaks maxima, were analyzed. With increasing dose of Î³-radiation no significant changes were observed in the short wavelength emission range (220â450Â nm) of the measured spectra. For doses of 4Â kGy and higher the long wavelength emission (450â800Â nm) started to be visible. All recorded spectra have been expressed in a form of the sum of several Gaussian-shape bands in the energy domain, which parameters remain in a general agreement with the measurements of Mandowska etÂ al. (2010). Spectra of the low-temperature, main, high-temperature and âBâ \{TL\} peaks were investigated. In the ranges of the low-temperature and the main dosimetric peaks, that is 100â125 and 210â230Â Â°C, respectively, the short wavelength emission disappeared with increasing dose and for the highest doses the long wavelength emission became dominant. Both the high-temperature (290â320Â Â°C) and the âBâ (370â425Â Â°C) peaks emission spectra exhibited somewhat different behavior with increasing dose. Initially, an even growth of the whole spectrum was observed and for doses higher than 16Â kGy the intensity of the spectrum decreased, but the short wavelength emission band fell significantly faster, in case of the high-temperature \{TL\} peaks. In case of the âBâ peak emission spectra the long wavelength emission did not play any role in the analyzed dose range. The spectra measured at the \{TL\} peaks maxima were also fitted with several Gaussian-shape bands. Dose-intensity dependences for all Gaussian-shape bands fitted to the measured spectra are also included in this paper. },

  Abstract                 = {High-sensitive thermoluminescent detectors LiF:Mg,Cu,P have been investigated after exposures with Î³-rays doses up to hundreds of kGy. Both emission spectra and \{TL\} glow curves have been measured up to temperature of 550Â Â°C. \{TL\} emission spectra integrated over a temperature range of 47â470Â Â°C were analyzed. Two emission regions, main (220â450Â nm) and long wavelength (450â800Â nm), were distinguished. No significant changes, with increasing dose, were observed in the main emission. The long wavelength emission was visible at the doses of 4Â kGy and higher, indicating that such an amount of energy, deposited in the detector volume, makes additional recombination centers active. At the âBâ peak temperature range (above 400Â Â°C), the wavelength of emitted light was nearly identical, as for the main glow peak (â¼220Â Â°C) at lower doses. It tends to suggest that high-dose high-temperature emission of MCP-N occurs along the same recombination path as the emission below the saturation level. Gaussian deconvolution in the energy domain was also performed for the measured spectra. The results of deconvolution remain in a general agreement with previous measurements. },

The detectors were irradiated using the nitrogen, iron, krypton and xenon ion beams, at energies ranging from 5.0 to 9.3 MeV/n. Supra- and sublinear response was found, for the MTS-N and MCP-N, respectively, similarly as observed for Î³-rays. However, the level of nonlinearity of response of studied detectors is strongly reduced by increasing values of the ion ionization density (no supralinearity for Xe ions, for MTS-N, within calculated uncertainties). The growth of high-temperature \{TL\} peaks, with increasing ionization density, was observed for MCP-N, what was not previously reported. At the whole range of applied energies higher efficiencies were noted for MTS-N, for all ion species. A decrease of the efficiency with decrease of the ion energy was confirmed, for both types of studied detectors. At a given energy, higher efficiency was observed for lighter ions, because of the lower ionization density. Significantly higher decrease of the efficiency was measured for MCP-N. The obtained results remain in a general agreement with other theoretical and experimental data. The data collected for the highest doses (fluences) of Xe ions will be used for testing a recently proposed method of experimental verification of radial dose distribution models. },

  Abstract                 = {The elevated temperature infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and post-IR \{IRSL\} signals of potassium (K)-feldspars have recently garnered attention for their minimal rates of anomalous fading. The post-IR \{IRSL\} signal has been used to obtain age estimates for geological deposits, mostly in Europe. Studies on the behaviour of the \{IRSL\} and post-IR \{IRSL\} signals of K-feldspars from a wider range of geographic regions and depositional contexts are needed, particularly for regions where the \{OSL\} signal from quartz is poorly behaved. Discrepancies in the literature regarding the behaviours of the \{IRSL\} and \{TL\} signals of K-feldspars also highlight the need to characterise the behaviours of samples from a wide variety of contexts. This paper begins to address this problem by characterising and comparing the \{IRSL\} signals of a metamorphic and a volcanic K-feldspar sample from two sites in East Africa, a region in which the \{OSL\} signal from quartz has generally proven problematic for dating. We demonstrate that the metamorphic and volcanic K-feldspars have substantially different \{TL\} glow curves that respond differently to \{IR\} stimulation. The sample of metamorphic K-feldspar from Tanzania (MR9) has a peak at 430Â Â°C that is associated with the \{IRSL\} signal and an optically less-sensitive peak at 350Â Â°C, while the sample of volcanic K-feldspar from Ethiopia (MB3) exhibits a single broad \{TL\} region centred at â¼230Â Â°C that responds differently to \{IR\} stimulation. Differences in the change of \{IRSL\} decay curve shape with stimulation temperature suggest that the processes of \{IRSL\} production many vary between the two samples. Using dose recovery tests, we demonstrate that the \{IRSL\} (50Â Â°C), \{IRSL\} (225Â Â°C) and post-IR \{IRSL\} (50Â Â°C, 225Â Â°C) signals of sample \{MR9\} are suitable for dose and age estimation using the single-aliquot regenerative-dose procedure, while those of sample \{MB3\} are less suitable. The post-IR \{IRSL\} signal of the latter sample performs poorly in tests of \{SAR\} suitability and the three signals exhibit extremely high fading rates over laboratory timescales (g2daysÂ &gt;Â 19%/decade). },

Component analysis suggests that the blue light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) measured at 60Â Â°C from K-feldspar can be fitted using three components, namely fast, medium and slow. In order to explore the relationship between the origin of the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal and the different components of the BLSL, five sets of experiments were conducted, namely post-IR \{BLSL\} (pIR-BLSL), post-BL \{IRSL\} (pBL-IRSL), pulse annealing tests, dose response and laboratory fading rate tests. It is observed that most of the \{IRSL\} signal can be bleached by BL, while the \{BLSL\} signal can only be partially bleached by the IR. The sources for \{IRSL\} are mainly associated with the fast and medium components of the \{BLSL\} signal. },

  Abstract                 = {The relative ionisation efficiencies of alanine dosimeters and tooth enamel differ greatly between gamma and X-ray irradiations. This can be attributed to the differences in the energy transfer mechanisms. When using Co or Cs sources, the photon energy is transferred to matter via Compton scattering, which shows little dependence on the average Z-value of the absorber. In contrast, the photon energies emitted from X-ray sources are usually much lower and energy is, at least in part, transferred to matter via the photo-electric effect, which has a cubic relationship between energy transfer and average Z-value of the absorber. The decomposition of the \{ESR\} spectra of an enamel fragment shows that the X-ray generated distribution of anisotropic C O 2 â radicals is virtually the same as in the natural sample, but quite different to gamma irradiated samples. This implies that X-rays are generally much better suited for \{ESR\} dating irradiation procedures than gamma rays. However, exact source calibration will be difficult. },

The per-pixel energy sensitivity of Timepix serves as a position-sensitive dE/dx detector to determine the energy loss over along the particle track. The sampling path pitch can be set to 55Â Î¼m (pixel-size) and arbitrary values between 300Â Î¼m (sensor thickness) and nearly 2Â mm. Timepix can register and visualize not only the position and trajectories but also the direction of trajectories and the rate of directional scattering of single fast electrons across the semiconductor sensor. The technique serves to measure the spatial distribution of a parallel beam, the beam size spread, transversal beam flux homogeneity and lateral straggling at the pixel-size scale. The mean scattering path along the beam axis and the mean path for lateral beam straggling in silicon can be determined. Measured energy loss distributions were compared with model and previous data as well as with dedicated Monte Carlo \{MCNPX\} simulations performed for this work. Tracking distributions were also simulated. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Highly sensitive electron multiplying charges coupled devices (EMCCD) enable the spatial detection of luminescence emissions from samples and have a high potential in single grain luminescence dating. However, the main challenge of this approach is the potential effect of cross talk, i.e. the influence of signal emitted by neighbouring grains, which will bias the information recorded from individual grains. Here, we present the first investigations into this phenomenon when performing single grain luminescence measurements of quartz grains spread over the flat surface of a sample carrier. Dose recovery tests using mixed populations show an important effect of cross talk, even when some distance is kept between grains. This issue is further investigated by focusing just on two grains and complemented by simulated experiments. Creation of an additional rejection criteria based on the brightness properties of the grains is inefficient in selecting grains unaffected by their surroundings. Therefore, the use of physical approaches or image processing algorithms to directly counteract cross talk is essential to allow routine single grain luminescence dating using \{EMCCD\} cameras. },

A 222Rn flux characterization was also done. A seasonal analysis of atmospheric 222Rn concentration was performed and results for each season present evidence associated with the origin of air masses reaching the El Arenosillo station. An increase in 222Rn concentration was observed when the wind came from Morocco, the Sierra Morena and the Guadalquivir valley areas. On the other hand, a net 222Rn concentration decrease was found when the wind came from the Atlantic Ocean and the South of Portugal. Low 222Rn flux of 4Â BqÂ mâ2Â hâ1 was measured. This result makes this station a useful site for studies related to remote 222Rn source contributions because of low local 222Rn background. The measured annual average concentration of 222Rn gas at the El Arenosillo station is 3.51Â Â±Â 0.05Â BqÂ mâ3 at 10Â m and 2.61Â Â±Â 0.05Â BqÂ mâ3 at 100Â m. },

  Abstract                 = {The physical and chemical characteristics of radon gas make it a good tracer for use in the application of atmospheric transport models. For this purpose the radon source needs to be known on a global scale and this is difficult to achieve by only direct experimental methods. However, indirect methods can provide radon flux maps on larger scales, but their reliability has to be carefully checked. It is the aim of this work to compare radon flux values obtained by direct and indirect methods in a measurement campaign performed in the summer of 2008. Different systems to directly measure radon flux from the soil surface and to measure the related parameters terrestrial Î³ dose and 226Ra activity in soil, for indirect estimation of radon flux, were tested. Four eastern Spanish sites with different geological and soil characteristics were selected: Teruel, Los Pedrones, Quintanar de la Orden and Madrid. The study shows the usefulness of both direct and indirect methods for obtaining radon flux data. Direct radon flux measurements by continuous and integrated monitors showed a coefficient of variation between 10% and 23%. At the same time, indirect methods based on correlations between 222Rn and terrestrial Î³ dose rate, or 226Ra activity in soil, provided results similar to the direct measurements, when these proxies were directly measured at the site. Larger discrepancies were found when proxy values were extracted from existing data bases. The participating members involved in the campaign study were the Institute of Energy Technology (INTE) of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC), Huelva University (UHU), and Basel University (BASEL). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract While reviews of comparisons between multi-grain \{OSL\} ages and independent chronological information are available in the literature, there is hardly any such performance test for single-grain \{OSL\} ages. And yet, this is all the more needed as the interpretation of single-grain dose distributions remains a difficult task, given the typically considerable dispersion in equivalent dose values measured by \{OSL\} â and the numerous sources of such dispersion in measurements. Here, we present the study of 19 samples for which independent age control is available, and whose ages range from 2 to 46Â ka. Based on multi-grain \{OSL\} age estimates, these samples are presumed to have been both well-bleached at burial, and unaffected by mixing after deposition. Two ways of estimating single-grain ages are then compared: the standard approach on the one hand, consisting of applying the Central Age Model to De values determined with the Analyst software; on the other hand, the central dose model recently proposed by CombÃ¨s etÂ al. (CombÃ¨s, B., Philippe, A., Lanos, P., Mercier, N., Tribolo, C., Guerin, G., Guibert, P., Lahaye, C., in press. Quaternary Geochronology). The median of the relative discrepancy between single-grain \{OSL\} and reference ages is about twice as large for the standard approach (12%) as with the Bayesian model (7%). Statistical tests show that, based on our (limited) dataset, the difference between the two models seems to be significant for samples in the age range 4â46Â ka. Finally, the influence of various factors on the (in-)accuracy of single grain \{OSL\} ages is discussed; it appears that the accuracy of ages estimated in a standard way decreases when age is increased, while the Bayesian model seems more robust. This study also shows that (i) there is no 20% limit on the \{CAM\} overdispersion parameter for well-bleached samples; (ii) dose recovery experiments do not seem to be a very reliable tool to estimate the accuracy of a \{SAR\} measurement protocol for age determination. },

  Abstract                 = {Water in soil affects the dose rate in sedimentary media. First it dilutes the radioelements, and second the mass stopping power as well as photon interaction cross sections are greater in water than in typical sediment constituents (Aitken, 1985). Here the effect of moisture on the gamma dose rate is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations based on the \{GEANT4\} toolkit. Dose deposition processes are studied on the scale of individual grains in modelled well-sorted sediments: detailed tracking of gamma rays and secondary electrons shed light on the relative importance of the different interaction modes at stake, as a function of grain size, porosity and fraction of saturation of the sediments, as well as the energy of gamma rays. A description of the specifically designed \{GEANT4\} codes is provided, followed by a comprehensive analysis of the phenomena. It is shown that geometry effects, specifically grain size and compactness, have a great impact on gamma dose rates received by sediment grains and that these can be quantified in the case of very simple grain assemblages. For a better accuracy in retrospective dosimetry dating methods, morphological features of the sediments that influence dose rates should be characterized and their influence on dose rate studied; Monte Carlo transport codes seem to be the favoured tools for that purpose. },

However the most widely used techniqueâthe âwindow techniqueââis time consuming and introduces important statistical uncertainty in the determination of the radioelement contents, and finally on the gamma dose rate. The threshold technique directly relates the number of counts recorded above certain threshold energy to the gamma dose rate. Recently new experimental measurements further investigated this technique but it has not been tested in various sedimentary media. In this paper, numerical simulations using a specifically designed Geant4 code allow to test the sensitivity of this technique to changes of sediments nature, humidity content and disequilibrium in the U-series. Finally another threshold technique, relating the gamma dose rate to the energy per unit time deposited above another threshold energy, is investigated. It is shown than the latter has a number of advantages compared to the classical techniques. Experimental results testing this approach are presented. },

The relevance of the infinite matrix assumption was found to be limited to specific cases and a discussion of potential errors in estimating dose rates to natural dosimeters in sedimentary media is proposed. A new set of geometric features is shown to be of paramount importance for estimating dose rates in sedimentary media. To quantify these effects, Monte Carlo modelling was applied and the architecture of the programmes is described. It is also shown that proper characterization of sediment samples, coupled to the modelling of radioactivity in these sediments may provide more accurate dose rates to quartz grains, down to the single grain scale. },

  Abstract                 = {Due to the recent new interest of the dosimetric community generated by evidence of larger number of induced cataracts for the same absorbed dose, in the frame work of the \{ORAMED\} project (Oramed, 2008) a task was devoted to the critical revision of the eye lens dose assessment procedures. The present paper summarizes the Monte Carlo analyses carried out to optimize the Hp(3,Î©) calculations in order to produce a set of conversion coefficients Hp(3,Î©)/Ka as close as possible to those of the limiting quantity HT(eye lens)/Ka. Comparison were carried out with already published values calculated for a previous theoretical phantom, mainly suited for the calculations of Hp(10,Î©)/Ka. },

Improving dosimetry for ophthalmic therapeutic applications is worthwhile. Accurate dose measurements require detectors of adequate dimensions with respect to small distances involved. The main objective of the work is the improvement of dosimetry accuracy with a high sensitivity and spatial resolution system such as \{EBT2\} GafchromicÂ® film. The relative depth dose, the 2D and 3D distributions, the source uniformity and asymmetry were obtained using custom tissue equivalent phantom. Experimental results were compared with manufacturerâs calibration certificate data, \{TPS\} calculated values and Monte Carlo simulation results. },

  Abstract                 = {Fly ash produced by coal-burning in thermal power station has become a subject of world wide interest in recent years because of its diverse uses in construction activities and considerable economic and environmental importance. Fly ash is used in the production of bricks, sheets, cement and also in land filling etc. Indian coals used in thermal power plants are found to have high ash contents, resulting in the production of large amount of fly ash. Coal contains radionuclides including uranium (the source of inert gas radon), Th and K. Thus coal combustion results in enhanced concentration of natural radionuclides 226Ra, 232Th and 40K. Since these radionuclides concentration in fly ash plays an important role in health physics it is important to measure radionuclides concentration in fly ash. In the present work enhanced radioactivity and radon exhalation rate from fly ash samples collected from a thermal power plant of \{NTPC\} (National Thermal Power Corporation), Dadri (U.P.) India, have been measured. A high resolution gamma ray spectroscopic system has been used for the measurement of natural radioactivity (226Ra, 232Th and 40K). Gamma spectrometric measurements were carried out at Inter-University Accelerator Centre, New Delhi using a coaxial n-type \{HPGe\} detector (EG&amp;G, ORTEC, Oak Ridge, USA). Activity concentration of 226Ra varies from 81.8Â Â±Â 2.2 to 177.3Â Â±Â 10.0Â BqÂ kgâ1 with an average value of 118.6Â Â±Â 7.4Â BqÂ kgâ1 and of 232Th from 111.6Â Â±Â 3.2 to 178.5Â Â±Â 3.9Â BqÂ kgâ1 with an average value of 147.0Â Â±Â 3.4Â BqÂ kgâ1. 40K activity was found to be below detection limit in some samples while other samples have shown potassium activity to vary from 365.9Â Â±Â 4.8 to 495.9Â Â±Â 6.2Â BqÂ kgâ1 with an average value of 352.0Â Â±Â 4.5Â BqÂ kgâ1. Surface radon exhalation rates (EA) and Mass exhalation rates (EM) in these samples were measured by âSealed can techniqueâ using LR-115 type \{II\} track detectors. \{EA\} is found to vary from 80.1Â Â±Â 9.3 to 242.7Â Â±Â 16.3Â mBqÂ mâ2Â hâ1 with an average value 155.5Â Â±Â 12.8Â mBqÂ mâ2Â hâ1, while \{EM\} varies from 3.1Â Â±Â 0.4 to 9.3Â Â±Â 0.6Â mBqÂ kgâ1Â hâ1 with an average value of 6.0Â Â±Â 0.5Â mBqÂ kgâ1Â hâ1. Radium equivalent activity (Raeq), related to the external gamma dose and internal dose due to radon and its daughters range from 283.2 to 422.4Â BqÂ kgâ1 with an average value of 353.9Â BqÂ kgâ1. The calculated values of external hazard index (Hex) vary from 0.77 to 1.87 with an average value of 1.03. Most of the samples show the value of Raeq close to the allowed upper limit of 370Â BqÂ kgâ1 and Hex close to unity respectively except in two samples. Annual effective dose varies from 0.15 to 0.23Â mSvÂ yâ1 with an average value 0.19Â mSvÂ yâ1. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The reconstruction of thermal histories of rocks (thermochronometry) is a fundamental tool both in Earth science and in geological exploration. However, few methods are currently capable of resolving the low-temperature thermal evolution of the upper â¼2 km of the Earth's crust. Here we introduce a new thermochronometer based on the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from feldspar, and validate the extrapolation of its response to artificial radiation and heat in the laboratory to natural environmental conditions. Specifically, we present a new detailed Na-feldspar \{IRSL\} thermochronology from a well-documented thermally-stable crustal environment at the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB). There, the natural luminescence of Na-feldspar extracted from twelve borehole samples (0.1â2.3 km depth, corresponding to 10â70âÂ°C) can be either (i) predicted within uncertainties from the current geothermal gradient, or (ii) inverted into a geothermal palaeogradient of 29 Â± 2 âÂ°Câkmâ1, integrating natural thermal conditions over the last â¼65 ka. The demonstrated ability to invert a depthâluminescence dataset into a meaningful geothermal palaeogradient opens new venues for reconstructing recent ambient temperatures of the shallow crust (&lt;0.3 Ma, 40â70âÂ°C range), or for studying equally recent and rapid transient cooling in active orogens (&lt;0.3 Ma, &gt;200âÂ°CâMaâ1 range). Although Na-feldspar \{IRSL\} is prone to field saturation in colder or slower environments, the method's primary relevance appears to be for borehole and tunnel studies, where it may offer remarkably recent (&lt;0.3 Ma) information on the thermal structure and history of hydrothermal fields, nuclear waste repositories and hydrocarbon reservoirs. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The classical equation of closure temperature ( T C ) in thermochronometry (Dodson, 1973), assumed (i) no storage limitation for the accumulating radiogenic product, (ii) a negligible product concentration at the initial temperature of cooling T 0 , and (iii) a negligible product loss at the final (present-day) temperature T P . A subsequent extension (Ganguly and Tirone, 1999) provided a simple correction for systems cooling from an arbitrary T 0 , at which presence of an initial concentration profile may affect final concentrations. Here, we use a combination of analytical and numerical solutions to derive a general expression for the effective closure temperature in (i) systems which cool between arbitrary initial and final temperatures, potentially still suffering from thermal product loss at T P (termed âleakyâ), and (ii) systems which may contain a physical limit on the maximum amount of product that can be stored (termed âsaturatingâ). While all conservative results can be easily reproduced, an extended use of our formulation provides meaningful effective closure temperatures even when the standard calculation schemes fail. For a first-order loss radiometric system governed by K ( T ) = s exp ( â E / R T ) , where E [Jâmolâ1] and s [sâ1] are the Arrhenius parameters and R is the gas constant, we find that the effective closure temperature T C ( T 0 , T P ) is given by: T C ( T 0 , T P ) = { 1 T P â R / E Ï Î» â Ï K P ln [ 1 + Ï Î» â Ï K P ( Ï K P ) Ï Î» e â Ï K P ( Î ( Ï Î» , Ï K P ) â Î ( Ï Î» , Ï K 0 ) ) ] } â 1 where K 0 and K P [sâ1] are shorthand for K ( T 0 ) and K ( T P ) , respectively, Î» [sâ1] the production rate, Ï [s] a time constant, and Î ( a , z ) the upper incomplete gamma function. Under conventional conditions, our solution reduces to DodsonÊ¼s formula. Although the solution strictly applies only to systems where 1 / T increases linearly with time, it is nevertheless a useful approximation for a broad range of cooling functions in systems where closure occurs close to the systemÊ¼s initial/final thermal boundary conditions. We clarify the use and the meaning of T C ( T 0 , T P ) by drawing a comparison between (i) a hypothetical application of apatite UâPb dating ( T C â 450 Â° C ) on Venus (mean surface temperature of 450âÂ°C, leaky behaviour), and (ii) the recently introduced thermochronometric application of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating on Earth (both leaky and saturating behaviour). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages can determine a wide range of geological events or processes, such as the timing of sediment deposition, the exposure duration of a rock surface, or the cooling rate of bedrock. The accuracy of \{OSL\} dating critically depends on our capability to describe the growth and decay of laboratory-regenerated luminescence signals. Here we review a selection of common models describing the response of infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) of feldspar to constant radiation and temperature as administered in the laboratory. We use this opportunity to introduce a general-order kinetic model that successfully captures the behaviour of different materials and experimental conditions with a minimum of model parameters, and thus appears suitable for future application and validation in natural environments. Finally, we evaluate all the presented models by their ability to accurately describe a recently published feldspar multi-elevated temperature post-IR \{IRSL\} (MET-pIRIR) dataset, and highlight each model's strengths and shortfalls. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The structures of the free radicals formed by the irradiation of potassium dithionate (K2S2O6) with 60Co Î³-rays and 14N7+ ions were investigated by \{EPR\} to further examine a recently proposed \{LET\} effect in this material. Two types of \{SO\} 3 â radical ions were identified in X-irradiated single crystals by measurements at X- and Q bands. One of these (S1) exhibited 33S hyperfine couplings Aâ¥Â =Â 12.49, A||Â =Â 15.60Â mT, the other (S2) Aâ¥Â =Â 11.29, A||Â =Â 13.92Â mT. The g-factors were nearly isotropic, gâ¥Â =Â 2.0010, g||Â =Â 2.0003; and gâ¥Â =Â 2.0026, g||Â =Â 2.0008, respectively. The 33S hyperfine coupling tensors and g-tensors were axially symmetric about the trigonal &lt;c&gt;-axis, coinciding with the direction of the SâS bonds of the two non-equivalent S 2 O 6 2 â ions in the crystal. A model for the radiation damage was proposed in which the \{SO\} 3 â radical ions retain the orientation of the \{SO3\} groups, aligned along the trigonal axis. The structure of a third main radical species (S3) with gâ¥Â =Â 2.0026, g||Â =Â 2.0052 could not be unambiguously assigned, due to undetected 33S features. The relative integrated intensities of S1, \{S2\} and \{S3\} depended on the radiation quality and were approximately estimated as 0.18: 0.65:0.17 for 60Co Î³-rays and 0.47: 0.38: 0.15 for 14N7+ ions. Additional weak lines on the low field side of the main signal were tentatively attributed to \{SO\} 2 â radical ions. An even weaker strongly anisotropic pair of lines was attributed to \{SO\} 3 â radical pairs separated by 0.93â0.95Â nm along the trigonal axis. },

  Abstract                 = {With an increasing interest in using protons and light ions for radiation therapy there is a need for possibilities to simultaneously determine both absorbed dose (D) and linear energy transfer, LET, (LÎ). Potassium dithionate (K2S2O6) tablets were irradiated in a conventional 6Â MV linear accelerator photon beam and a N7+ beam (EÂ =Â 33.5Â MeV/u) respectively. The \{EPR\} spectrum of irradiated potassium dithionate is a narrow doublet consisting of two signals, \{R1\} and R2, with different microwave power saturation properties. On the basis of identification in related substances by \{EPR\} and ENDOR, these two signals are assigned to two non-equivalent SO3â â radicals. Our experiments showed that the ratios of these two lines (R1/R2) were clearly connected to beam LET. Irrespective of the mechanistic details this investigation suggests a new method for measurement of absorbed dose and beam \{LET\} by using potassium dithionate \{EPR\} dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {Earlier, the sensitization of a thermoluminescence (TL) peak near 300Â Â°C in SolonÃ³pole quartz was investigated taking into account the combined effect of heat-treatments and irradiation with high doses of Î³ rays. At that time, it was shown that the sequence: heat at 500Â Â°C, irradiation at 25Â kGy and annealing at 400Â Â°C, was a suitable procedure to measure doses as low as 0.1Â mGy using this quartz. However, sensitization with doses higher than 50Â kGy and the kinetic analysis of the 300Â Â°C peak were not considered. The aim of the present study is to measure the \{TL\} sensitivity and the main kinetic parameters of this peak as a function of various sensitization conditions. Five lots of samples were sensitized at different heating temperatures and incremental doses up to 200Â kGy. The activation energy was calculated by the peak-shape and the repeated initial rise methods. As a result, the decay noticed in \{TL\} sensitivity above 100Â kGy was less intense for the lots that were heated before irradiation. The geometrical factor analysis was important to clarify the kinetic-order and the probability of retrapping for each condition of sensitization. The activation energies measured by each method are in fair agreement with each other and were mainly affected by the heat-treatment performed at 1000Â Â°C before irradiation. Activation energies averaging (1.51Â Â±Â 0.06)Â eV were calculated for untreated and heat-treated lots at 500 and 800Â Â°C. },

The \{TL\} emission spectra and monochromatic glow curves indicate that the two main impurities governing the \{TL\} emission are Dy3+ (LTP) and Tb3+ (HTP). The anomalous fading of the \{TL\} signal was assigned to the emission associated with Dy3+ whereas the 545Â nm emission associated with Tb3+, exhibits significantly lower fading and consequently more suitable for \{TL\} dating. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract For luminescence dating to be an accurate absolute dating technique it is very important that we are able to deliver absolutely known radiation doses in the laboratory. This is normally done using a radiation source (alpha, beta, X-ray) calibrated against an absolutely known reference source. Many laboratories have used the various different batches of RisÃ¸ calibration quartz for the calibration of beta and X-ray sources, but these have been largely undescribed. Here we describe in detail the preparation and luminescence characteristics of a new quartz standard, based on a North Sea beach sand collected from south-western Denmark (RÃ¸mÃ¸). Two grain sizes (4â11 Î¼m and 180â250 Î¼m) have been examined in detail. These were pre-treated (annealed, dosed and annealed again) to sensitise and stabilise the luminescence signals before being given an absolutely known gamma dose from a point 137Cs source in scatter-free geometry. The luminescence characteristics are described; the very intense blue-light stimulated signal is dominated by the fast \{OSL\} component and the IR-stimulated signal is negligible. The material is shown to be suitable for measurement using SAR, and the dose recovery ratio is indistinguishable from unity with a standard deviation of &lt;2% for multi-grain aliquots. The material is also shown to be suitable for single-grain calibration, with &gt;80% of the grains giving a useful signal. Although there is an unexplained dispersion in our calibration data of â¼3% (which we cannot attribute to instrument variability), we nevertheless conclude that this material is very suitable for transferring absolute known doses from a standardised gamma source to in-built irradiation sources. },

The work described in the following papers in this edition was presented at a Workshop on Dosimetry for Second Cancer Risk Estimation given at the \{EURADOS\} Annual meeting in Vienna on February 8th 2012. The work concentrates on the measurement of out-of-field doses in water tanks and BOMAB-like phantoms using a variety of dosimeters to measure photon and neutron doses. These include optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), radiophotoluminescence (RPL) and thermoluminescence (TLD) dosimeters for photon dosimetry (together with ion chambers for reference measurements traceable to primary standards) and track etch and bubble detectors for neutron measurements. A discussion of the various phantoms available for these measurements is presented together with a brief introduction to a model for the relationship between organ doses and the risk of induction of second cancers. The estimation of second cancer risks is not trivial and involves processes which are currently incompletely understood. However, progress in this field requires a robust foundation and methodology for the measurement or calculation of organ doses following radiotherapy, so that risks can be placed in perspective, algorithms for out-of-field doses can be compared with measured data, and future epidemiological studies may have a reliable foundation of organ dosimetry for retrospective dosimetry studies. },

To test post-irradiation fading, 99 calibrated 3.2Â ÃÂ 3.2Â ÃÂ 0.9Â mm3 LiF:Mg,Ti thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) of dimensions were first annealed. The set was then irradiated to an average of 4.4Â mGy using a 3.2Â ÃÂ 1011 Bq 137Cs source. The irradiated \{TLDs\} were allowed to fade at room temperature for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, or 17Â d. The \{TLDs\} were then read out over a 3.5Â h time period using a standard commercial hot planchet \{TLD\} reader with nitrogen gas to prevent chemiluminescence. The experiment was then repeated for the other fading times. To test pre-irradiation fading, the \{TLDs\} were annealed, then placed in storage for 0.5, 1.6, 3, 4, 8, 18, 27, or 43Â d. After that time, the \{TLDs\} were irradiated and read out. A computerized glow curve deconvolution program was used to fit the glow curve data to a four-peak first-order Gaussian kinetics model. The areas of peaks 2, 3, 4, and 5 were retrieved in order to be studied alone, as well as normalized to other peaks. The peak areas and peak area ratios were then fit to two or three term exponential decay equations that allowed the determination of the fading rate by calculating their parameters. These parameters were then compared for different \{TLDs\} in order to determine if their values followed a Gaussian distribution. Then, a group mean and standard deviation could be used for each value for all \{TLDs\} for later use instead of calculating an individual mean for each TLD. },

  Abstract                 = {Building materials used in Japan were collected from several companies and their radionuclide concentrations were measured. Fifteen granite samples with high activity concentrations were selected for the present study. To investigate the effect of water content on the radon emanation coefficient, the coefficient was measured under 3 different conditions (dry, normal, and wet). The emanation coefficients were then used to calculate the alpha equivalent dose (dose from indoor radon generated from building materials), assuming a simple room model. The radon emanation coefficient for the dry condition ranged from (3.7Â Â±Â 0.1)% to (27.2Â Â±Â 3.9)%, with an average value of (10.5Â Â±Â 1.4)%. The emanation coefficients were 2â5 times that size for the wet condition. Similarly, the alpha dose became larger, owing to its proportion to the emanation coefficient, indicating that water content in building materials is an important factor for the emanation coefficient as well as the radiation dose. The radon exhalation rate was also measured for the dry samples. Radon exhalation rate and radium concentration had a relatively low correlation (R2Â =Â 0.40). However, the correlation between radon exhalation rate and âemanated radon concentrationâ (radium concentrationÂ ÃÂ emanation coefficient) was much higher (R2Â =Â 0.84). Therefore, emanated radon concentration could be a useful index for exhalation rate and alpha equivalent dose, but radium concentration in building materials alone is not. },

The sensitivity is enhanced when carbon dioxide is released toward the chemical etching solution that passes through the detector surface. Segmented \{PADC\} polymer chains are washed away by the flow of carbon dioxide along the latent tracks in PADC, which results in a higher track etch rate. },

  Abstract                 = {A reliable direct dating method for archaeometallurgic slag has not yet been achieved. Nevertheless, in archaeological and environmental research information about the age of slag deposits is urgently needed. Metallurgical slag consists of many components. Artificial secondary minerals, for example fayalit, olivine and glass phases are the dominant parts. In many cases primary minerals, called relicts, are also components of slag. Quartz, baryte and fluorite are examples. Such a complex composition leads to large difficulties in paleodose determination if the bulk slag substance is used. On the other hand, slag has a complicated microdosimetry caused by great differences between the individual mineral phases and the possibility of inhomogeneous radionuclide distribution. To overcome these problems in luminescence dating defined phases of the slag have been separated by special chemical and physical procedures. Quartz and glass fractions were investigated by thermoluminescence (TL) and radioluminescence (RL)-spectrometry. Alpha-autoradiography using Kodak LR-115 foil was carried out to get information about the distribution of radionuclides. },

  Abstract                 = {Rapid and accurate retrospective dosimetry is of critical importance and strategic value for the emergency medical response to a large-scale radiological/nuclear event. One technique that has the potential for rapid and accurate dosimetry measurements is electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of relatively stable radiation-induced signals (RIS) in fingernails and toenails. Two approaches are being developed for \{EPR\} nail dosimetry. In the approach using exÂ vivo measurements on nail clippings, accurate estimation of the dose-dependent amplitude of the \{RIS\} is complicated by the presence of mechanically-induced signals (MIS) that are generated during the nail clipping. Recent developments in exÂ vivo nail dosimetry, including a thorough characterization of the \{MIS\} and an appreciation of the role of hydration and the development of effective analytic techniques, have led to improvements in the accuracy and precision of this approach. An inÂ vivo nail dosimetry approach is also very promising, as it eliminates the problems of \{MIS\} from the clipping and it has the potential to be an effective and efficient approach for field deployment. Two types of \{EPR\} resonators are being developed for inÂ vivo measurements of fingernails and toenails. },

  Abstract                 = {The taxonomy of the land-snail genus Cerion, and the relevance of hundreds of shell forms to phylogenetic and evolutionary processes has been the subject of much discussion over the past few decades. Fundamental to understanding evolutionary trends is the independent confirmation of the age, biostratigraphic, and chronostratigraphic order of a comprehensive set of fossil forms. Amino acid racemization (AAR) is a geochronological tool applicable to dating living and fossil Cerion shells. The extent of racemization of aspartic acid (Asp D/L) and glutamic acid (Glu D/L) were determined for 507 Cerion shells dating between the early last interglaciation (marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e, c. 125 ka) and the present from the Bahamas. The \{AAR\} data based on Cerion support the established morphostratigraphic succession of deposits younger than \{MIS\} 5e and provide greater resolution, particularly for biostratigraphic successions of Holocene age. Age models were constructed for Asp and Glu using D/L values paired with 14C ages and historical collection dates from 23 Cerion shells. In addition to the relative-age time series, the Holocene age models developed from D/L Glu and Asp apply to the last 7 ka and geographically within the central Bahamas. In two case studies, large numbers of AAR-generated ages provide insights into the age structure of accretionary soils and rates and age constraints on evolutionary processes related to Cerion land snails. },

However, this monitor can be used universally for neutrons of any energy distribution. Using scaling factors, fluence calibration curves for 1Â MeV and 14Â MeV D+T fusion neutrons have been calculated. The sensitivity of the detector increases with increasing neutron energy. This makes it suitable for the detection of high-energy neutrons, providing an extra advantage for use at a proton therapy facility where there is a high proportion of high-energy neutrons. The detector is practically not sensitive to photons.

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity of charged particle registration with \{SSNTD\} is the most important parameter to decide about the applicability of those detectors in research, technology and environmental dosimetry. The sensitivity is strongly influenced by the treatment of detector samples before, during and after the exposure and the final evaluation process by chemical etching. Whereas changes in detection properties by external environmental influences are generally considered, the dependences on the etching conditions are ignored. Commonly the sensitivity is assumed to compensate variations in the etching conditions for track revealing. In the present work the validity of this hypothesis will be checked. In the frame of the existing database the sensitivity is not really independent on variations in etching temperatures and should be corrected for differences in the activation energies for stimulation of the bulk and track etching process. Differences in the concentration dependence may be of minor importance. Furthermore, the registration sensitivity depends on environmental conditions before, during and after the irradiation with particles under investigation. Such external parameters are the air pressure, the sample temperature and modification of bulk material by out-gassing in vacuum and exposure to Î³-rays. However, the available database is insufficient and inaccurate to draw final conclusions on the detection properties of \{SSNTD\} under various external and internal conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nuclear particle spectroscopy with \{SSNTD\} can be more reliable performed by measurement of the track length of over-etched tracks than by the commonly applied method of track diameter calibration. This has been postulated by a recent paper by El Ghazaly in 2012. In the present work, this suggestion is studied by an analysis of most recent and unpublished new experimental data for the length evolution of 4He-ion tracks with increasing etching time. According to a proposal made by Azooz etÂ al. in 2012 to the time dependent track length development can be described by an empirical analytical expression. Using these new data the parameters of this model were determined by a fitting procedure. The analytical description of the track length can be used to calculate related quantities like the track etch rate vT in dependence on the etching time and the corresponding depth of the track pit in the detector. The results calculated by this parameterization are compared with data obtained by the commonly applied troublesome point-by-point graphical solution. Finally, a formula was derived for calculation of the etching time necessary to get over-etched tracks. },

  Abstract                 = {Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating based on the fast component is now widely used to establish chronologies of sedimentary deposits. Since this component saturates at a relatively low dose, the method is limited to the dating of Late Pleistocene quartz samples. Consequently, dating events beyond this limit is a key challenge. In this context the use of the TT-OSL signal which exhibits a high doses saturation level offers the potential to extend the age range of the method. Since the promising study of Wang etÂ al. (2006b), in which a 780Â ka age validated by palaeomagnetism data was reported for a Chinese loess sample, several studies focused on establishing a \{SAR\} TT-OSL dating protocol. They suggested applying different kinds of heat treatment at the end of a \{SAR\} cycle, as well as two normalisation procedures. The aim of this study was to test the reliability of these protocols for a loess-like Middle Pleistocene sample for which the expected De is known approximatively. We tested four published \{SAR\} protocols by implementing the dose recovery tests on artificially bleached quartz aliquots. The results obtained showed a systematic overestimation of the recovered doses and revealed high sensitivity changes between the first (natural) and the following cycles. It is believed that this behaviour is a consequence of the thermal treatment applied at the end of each \{SAR\} cycle which is necessary to empty the hard-to-bleach TT-OSL traps. Neither \{OSL\} nor TT-OSL signal test dose responses proved suitable to correct this sensitivity change. },

The irradiated crystals were analyzed using their thermoluminescence and optical absorption properties. The F-centers formed in these crystals were measured as a function of the dose. The production of irradiation defects in the solid were correlated with the glow curve. Bleaching the F-centers produced a decrease in the peak of the glow curve, suggesting that F centers are intimately involved in the production of the thermoluminescence phenomenon. For the NaCl crystals doped with Cd, the area under the peak observed in the glow curves (associated to very deep traps) changes uniformly in the 1.15â13.8Â Gy dose intervals, making this crystal a candidate for use as a dosimeter in low dose intervals. },

In this paper, the process consisting in a double measurement method after the Sr radiochemical isolation is analyzed, developing the formulae to obtain activity concentrations, uncertainties and detection limits. A study of the trend of uncertainties and detection limits as function of the time in which the first measurement since the isolation is done, the delay between the two measurements and the activity concentration of each strontium isotope in the sample is carried out as well. Results show that with a very precise determination of the times involved in the whole process (isolation, measurement and duration of measurements) this method permits a reliable assessment of both strontium radioisotopes. The quicker the first measurement since the isolation is done and the longer the delay between measurements is chosen, the lower are the detection limits and the uncertainties of the activities obtained. },

  Abstract                 = {Solid state dosimetry in therapeutic ion beams is seriously hampered by ionisation density effects. In most cases the use of empirical corrections is limited and therefore model predictions, especially from amorphous track models (ATMs), play a major role. Due to its high saturation dose and simple dose response, the alanine detector can help to study fundamental assumptions and accuracy in amorphous track modelling. The libamtrack project enabled recently to directly compare various flavours of ATMs. We therefore present here the potential of predictions for alanine from two libamtrack \{ATMs\} with experimental data as first part of a greater study. We find very good agreement for protons, helium and carbon ions for thin targets. For thick targets, however, the two compared algorithms show differences, with one generally better matching the data. Additional assumptions which have to be made on particle transport and stopping powers hinders a thorough interpretation of the deviation found and stress the necessity for a broader data base at lower particle energies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Radiation portal monitors (RPMs) are distributed across the globe in an effort to decrease the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Many current generation \{RPMs\} utilizes large polyvinyltoluene (PVT) plastic scintillators. These detectors are low cost and reliable but have very poor energy resolution. The lack of spectroscopic detail available from \{PVT\} spectra has restricted these systems primarily to performing simple gross counting measurements in the past. A common approach to extend the capability of \{PVT\} detectors beyond simple âgross-gammaâ use is to apply a technique known as energy windowing (EW) to perform rough nuclide identification with limited spectral information. An approach to creating \{EW\} algorithms was developed in this work utilizing a specific set of calibration sources and modified \{EW\} equations; this algorithm provided a degree of increased identification capability. A simulated real-time emulation of the algorithm utilizing actual port-of-entry \{RPM\} data supplied by \{ORNL\} provided an extensive proving ground for the algorithm. This algorithm is able to identify four potential threat nuclides and the major \{NORM\} source with a high degree of accuracy. High-energy masking, a major detriment of \{EW\} algorithms, is reduced by the algorithm's design. },

The photon contribution to the ambient dose equivalent in the neutron fields of the 252Cf and 241AmâBe sources was measured using various photon dose rate meters and active and passive dosimeters. Measuring photons from a neutron source usually involves considerable uncertainties due to the presence of neutron induced photons in the room, due to a non-zero neutron sensitivity of the photon detector, and last but not least due to the energy response of the photon detectors. Therefore eight independent detectors and methods were used to obtain a reliable estimate for the photon contribution of the two sources as an average of the individual methods. For the 241AmâBe source a photon contribution of approximately 4.9% was determined and for the 252Cf source a contribution of 3.6%. },

Here a new method to correct dead-time using a multichannel list mode neutron counter is described. As it will become clear in this article, the data analysis can be done âon the flyâ without further data storage. This will allow an instrument to be built having this method implemented, which will give directly dead-time corrected results. In practice, a classical theory of dead-time correction is applied to the final Totals, Reals (or Doubles) and possibly Triples, whereas for higher multiplicities no dead-time correction has been implemented so far. In contrast to that, this approach directly corrects the multiplicity distributions of the Reals plus Accidentals (R + A) and Accidentals (A) obtained by multiplicity counting. Hence this dead-time correction holds for any kind of multiplicity (Totals, Doubles, Triples, Quadruples, Quintuples, etc.) because the calculation of these values can then be derived directly from the corrected multiplicity distribution of R + A and A. },

Although Al2O3:C has a high sensitivity to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, the material has the disadvantage of insufficiency of sensitivity to neutrons. In this study, we have investigated neutron detection efficiency of Al2O3:C crystal coated with various thicknesses of Li using OSL. As a result, the \{OSL\} intensity increases as the thickness of Li becomes thicker, up to 7.6Â Î¼m thickness of Li investigated in this study. In addition, we found neutron detection sensitivity was not linearly proportional to the thickness of Li. },

  Abstract                 = {For large scale exposures of the human population to ionising radiation, there is a need for cost-effective high throughput assessment of radiation exposure levels from biological samples to allow triage decisions to be made. Here we assess the usefulness of \{H2AX\} phosphorylation, 53BP1 foci formation, p53 induction and caspase activation as tools for biological dosimetry. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors were isolated and exposed to X-rays. Cells were fixed, permeabilised and then stained with primary antibodies for Î³-H2AX and/or 53BP1, p53 or \{FLICA\} caspase detection kit followed by fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were \{DAPI\} or propidium iodide counterstained for microscopy or cytometry respectively. Average Î³-H2AX/53BP1 foci numbers and Î³-H2AX fluorescence intensities increased with dose. Foci loss occurred over a period of 24Â h post exposure with foci levels remaining above baseline levels for at least 24Â h following exposure to 0.5Â Gy or more of X-rays. p53 levels increased with dose and over time, peaking at 48Â h post exposure. Apoptotic cells were highlighted with greatly increased levels of activated caspases. A single dose of 4Â Gy increased the percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes to over 60% at 96Â h post exposure. The finding that the biomarkers analysed here have different temporal dynamics following radiation exposure suggests that they could be combined to enable detection of exposures over a period of hours to several days after a radiation incident to help facilitate rapid triage. },

  Abstract                 = {Three outstanding effects of ionization density on the thermoluminescence (TL) mechanisms giving rise to the glow peaks of LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-100) are currently under investigation: (i) the dependence of the heavy charged particle (HCP) relative efficiency on ionization density and the effectiveness of its modeling by track structure theory (TST) (ii) the behavior of the \{TL\} efficiency, f(D), as a function of photon energy and dose and (iii) the shape of composite peak 5 in the glow curve for various \{HCP\} types and energies and following high dose electron irradiation. It is concluded that (i) The predictions of \{TST\} are very strongly dependent on the choice of photon energy used in the determination of f(D), (ii) Modified \{TST\} employing calculated values of f(D) at 2Â keV is in agreement with 5Â MeV alpha particle experimental results for composite peak 5 but underestimates the 1.5Â MeV proton relative efficiencies. Both the proton and alpha particle relative \{TL\} efficiencies of the high temperature \{TL\} (HTTL) peaks 7 and 8 are underestimated by an order of magnitude suggesting that the \{HTTL\} efficiencies are affected by other factors in addition to radial electron dose. (iii) The dose response supralinearity of peaks 7 and 8 change rapidly with photon energy: this behavior is explained in the framework of the Unified Interaction Model as due to a very strong dependence on photon energy of the relative intensity of localized recombination, (iv) The increased width and decrease in Tmax of composite peak 5 as a function of ionization density is due to the greater relative intensity of peak 5a (a low temperature component of peak 5 arising from two-energy-transfer events which leads to localized recombination). },

  Abstract                 = {Dosimetry studies are of increasing interest in diagnostic high-dose applications such as computed tomography especially for examinations of children. A routine \{CT\} scan protocol for paediatric head and neck imaging was investigated at a new multi-detector \{CT\} scanner using LiF:Mg,Cu,P thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs) and a 0.125Â cm3 thimble ionization chamber. Calibrations of the detectors in terms of absorbed dose to water were carried out at the Dosimetry Laboratory Seibersdorf in standard radiation fields. The dosimetry method was validated in the spiral \{CT\} X-ray field by comparing \{TLD\} and ionization chamber measurement results in cylindrical \{PMMA\} phantoms. Absorbed dose results were within stated uncertainties. An anthropomorphic phantom representing a child of about 5 years was loaded with \{TLD\} chips at various organ and tissue positions in the head and neck region as well as at some critical organ locations. Organ dose values were calculated from \{TLD\} based average absorbed dose with about 5% total uncertainty, e.g. 22Â mGy (eyes), 21Â mGy (thyroid), 19Â mGy (brain), 3.4Â mGy (thymus), and 0.03Â mGy (testes). For comparison purposes an effective dose of 1.9Â mSv was estimated for the investigated paediatric \{CT\} examination based on ICRP-103 age-independent tissue-weighting factors. },

  Abstract                 = {The accurate determination of absorbed dose in small photon beams, especially for stereotactic radiation therapy, is a difficult task with commercially available detectors. As these small fields are characterized by high dose gradients, a lack of lateral particle equilibrium and a variation of energy spectra with beam sizes, a dosimeter with high resolution, tissue-equivalence and high precision is required. The new radiochromic film EBT2, which meets these criteria, was fully characterized in Institut de Radioprotection et SÃ»retÃ© NuclÃ©aire (IRSN) for this application. This type of film was tested with the reading system \{EPSON\} Dual Lens Perfection \{V700\} flatbed scanner in transmission mode. Warm-up effects of the scanner were studied as well as the influence of the scanner light. Uniformity of unirradiated and irradiated \{EBT2\} films in terms of pixel value was found to be respectively 0.3% (1 SD) and 0.5% (1 SD). An original, accurate and efficient radiochromic film dosimetry protocol was established. The overall uncertainty for dose measurement with \{EBT2\} films using this protocol was estimated at less than 2% (1 SD). Encouraging measurements of output factors were performed on a Novalis system. },

In this study the \{TL\} is analysed from a wide range of domestic salts, sourced from Australasia, Europe, Asia and America. The emission spectra for pre-existing or âNaturalâ \{TL\} (NTL) and laboratory-irradiated âArtificialâ \{TL\} (ATL) were analysed using a Fourier Transform spectrometer, giving luminescence intensity as a function of temperature and photon energy. Fading behaviour in the candidate \{TL\} emission peaks, observed at 200â260Â Â°C under the measurement conditions used, was investigated at various storage temperatures and storage intervals between irradiation and read-out. This included \{TL\} emission spectral measurements at storage intervals ranging from minutes to months. Nearly all samples showed strong \{ATL\} emission at 590Â nm, with much weaker emission from the commonly measured UV-blue region. \{NTL\} was very small or undetected for most samples. The storage tests showed that the \{TL\} in the 260Â Â°C region is relatively stable and we conclude that \{TL\} from NaCl possesses suitable dose sensitivity and stability for use as an opportunistic retrospective dosimeter. },

For bleached sediment, the IR-RF intensities are found to be at their highest values while it falls at its lowest when it reaches dose saturation. During bleaching, it was shown that a sample emits phosphorescence immediately after bleaching, yet very little is known about it. Here, we will try to identify the source for these trapped electrons. Recent communications in radiofluorescence, have observed an unexpected increase in the beginning of an irradiation, mostly seen in regenerated luminescence. At first glance, this would imply that the increase is tied to an increasingly higher electron capture by the dating trap, during the onset of irradiation. We show that this initial increase is simply due to minute variation in temperature, occurring during the measurements. },

  Abstract                 = {Solid State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs), CR-39â¢ type, are usually adopted in many applications in which it could be necessary to select tracks according to the incident alpha-particle energy; so several authors have argued that track parameters such as the major/minor axis being the most often reported, can be used to determine the alpha-particleâs energy. However, the use of these parameters only do an univocal result, for example the same axis length can be obtained for different combinations of incident angles and energies. We report on a track analysis performed by a semiautomatic system that classifies tracks according to two parameters, diameter length and mean grey level. This kind of analysis can give information about the track depth, that increases monotonically with the incident energy and angle of the alpha particle. Combining the information on the two parameters it is possible to determine univocally the incident alpha-particle energy values. In order to characterize CR-39 detectors according to the physical track parameters, detectors were irradiated, inside a vacuum chamber, by alpha particles at thirteen energy values, obtained by different mylar layers in front of a 241Am source. After the exposure the detectors were chemically etched to enlarge the tracks and then analyzed by means of a semiautomatic system, consisting on an optical microscope equipped with a \{CCD\} camera connected to a personal computer for image storage. A suitable routine analyzed the track parameters: diameter and mean grey level, allowing us to differentiate tracks according to the incident alpha-particle energy and then to individuate the discrimination factors for radon alpha tracks, when nuclear track detectors are applied in radon surveys. },

  Abstract                 = {\{ENDOR\} spectra and ENDOR-induced \{EPR\} spectra (dependences of \{ENDOR\} signals vs. the value of magnetic field B) of Î³-irradiated bone plates and powders are studied. Typical \{ENDOR\} spectrum consisted of two signals centred at the Larmor frequencies of 1H and 31P nuclei, respectively. The \{ENDOR\} signals were found to be the superposition of the signals of axial (oriented) and orthorhombic (disordered) CO2â radicals. Changes of the ratio between the \{ENDOR\} signal intensities for gâ and gâ¥ at the rotation of the plate in the magnetic field is explained by the orientation-dependent redistribution of the \{EPR\} spectral density. EI-EPR spectra satisfactorily coincide with the spectra of conventional \{EPR\} absorption. Changes of \{ENDOR\} spectrum at the annealing of a sample before Î³-irradiation (TannÂ =Â 400Â Â°C) are explained by Larmor \{ENDOR\} mechanism. Larmor \{ENDOR\} mechanism is associated with diffusive polarization of distant (far from a paramagnetic center) âfreeâ nuclei under the conditions of \{EPR\} signal saturation and their depolarization by radio-frequency field in ENDOR. },

The sensitivity of this new emulsion, which is described in terms of the stopping power and grain density, was estimated experimentally by neutron irradiation at several energies. The response of the emulsion to gamma-ray-induced electrons was also simulated and the results were compared with experimental data obtained using a 60Co gamma source. The results indicated that each AgBr grain has a threshold energy that must be deposited before the AgBr can develop into metallic Ag. Based on these results, the efficiency of the new emulsion in detecting gamma rays and neutrons was evaluated. },

  Abstract                 = {The fission-track method has been applied to date volcanic glass from Quaternary tephra. The size of the spontaneous tracks in the volcanic glass is reduced at ambient temperatures, so the calculated age is often less than the expected eruption age. The underestimation of fission-track ages has been corrected using several methods, some of which have disadvantages in terms of time-consuming experiments and the use of radioactive materials. We examined a new protocol for the fission-track dating of glass that involves estimation of the track number per unit volume in a stepwise etching experiment and measurement of the 238U concentration by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The bulk etching rate (Veg) is estimated in track geometry analyses using an assumed track etching model. As a result, reliable values for Veg and the track density are obtained, suggesting that this new dating protocol has the potential to provide reliable fission-track ages without nuclear irradiation and complicated age correction procedures. },

Glow curve deconvolution into 8 peaks (3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b, 7, 8 and 9) was performed in order to evaluate the response of individual peaks and regions of interest in the glow curve. Results show that all peaks display a linear response, at least up to 200Â mGy, for all X-ray beam qualities. The relative response of the total glow curve area, the dosimetric region (peaks 3Â +Â 4Â +Â 5) and peaks 5 to 9 is statistically constant for beams generated by voltages from 30 to 70Â kV; for 80Â kV, the values are lower by about 20% for peaks 8 and 9 and 9% for the rest. The relative efficiency for the glow curve area, the dosimetric region and peaks 5 (1.15, 1.10 and 1.13), peaks 8 and 9 (2.05 and 1.55) do not depend on the beam spectrum between 30 and 70Â kV, while for 80Â kV the efficiency is lower.

Dating of the footprint-bearing aeolianite proved a lengthy and problematic task. Previous age estimates included a radiocarbon age of 29,090 â 390 + 410 years \{BP\} [Deacon, H.J., 1966. The dating of the Nahoon footprints. South African Journal of Science 62, 111â113], an infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) age of 144 Â± 4 ka, a thermoluminescence age of 236 Â± 8 ka (TL) and a luminescence subtraction age based on the \{IRSL\} and \{TL\} estimates of 75 Â± 9 ka [Vogel, J.C., Wintle, A.G., Woodborne, S.M., 1999. Luminescence dating of coastal sands: overcoming changes in environmental dose rate. Journal of Archaeological Science 26, 729â733]. Thus there was no consistency among the ages derived using different dating methods. Here we describe optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz grains from a new set of samples collected from the footprint-bearing aeolianite and from associated geological formations. We also re-assessed the dose rate parameters for the sample for which \{TL\} and \{IRSL\} ages were reported and analysed the \{OSL\} signal from this sample. The new \{OSL\} dating yielded a coherent series of ages consistent with the stratigraphy as well as global and local sea level history. The indicated footprint age of 124 Â± 4 ka thus relates to an important period of modern human evolution. },

  Abstract                 = {The 2D-OSL system, previously described by Jahn etÂ al. (2010), was enhanced. Two methods of stimulation and OSL-detection were evaluated. Using single fiber stimulation the blue stimulation light of a \{LED\} was inserted into a fiber. With the help of a focuser a spot of 0.5Â mm diameter on the detector was stimulated. \{OSL\} reading was performed by a photosensor module from the opposite detector side. With the help of a 2D axial system BeO area detectors (Thermalox 995 â 52Â mmÂ ÃÂ 52Â mmÂ ÃÂ 1Â mm) were positioned between the stimulation element and the photosensor module. A line-by-line scanning gave information about the dose distribution in the detector. Evaluated spatial resolution is approx. 1Â mm. Due to more intensive stimulation by the focusing of \{LED\} light the evaluation time could be decreased to 10Â min for an area of 52Â ÃÂ 52Â mm2 which is suitable for scientific applications. For medical applications the speed has to be increased. Therefore a prototype, the multifiber array was tested. It offers the ability to evaluate a line of 4Â mm by the use of 8 fibers for stimulation and 8 fibers for OSL-detection with a pitch of 0.5Â mm. So the line could be measured without any detector movement. Spatial resolution is better than using single fiber stimulation, measurement time for an area detector could be decreased by a factor 5. The use of multifiber arrays with more than 8 fibers offers fast detector scanning, so appliance in medicine would be possible. The dosimetric properties of the BeO area detectors were consistent with the smaller detectors (Thermalox 995 â 4.7Â mmÂ ÃÂ 4.7Â mmÂ ÃÂ 0.5Â mm) examined by Sommer etÂ al., (2007). So, with both methods, 2D-radiation fields could be monitored. One example, the imaging of several absorbers, is shown. },

  Abstract                 = {The BeOmax-system uses the \{OSL\} of BeO for dose measurement. The OSL-Material is Thermalox 995â¢ from Materion CeramicsÂ® in quadratic or cylindrical form. For an easy handling complete dosimeters with encapsulated quadratic detectors and identification code for automatic evaluation are also available. Stimulation of detectors is performed with a blue \{LED\} (455Â nm), \{OSL\} signal (UV-region) is detected with a Hamamatsu photo sensor module (PSM) from the opposite detector side. Several filters to avoid stimulation light reaching the \{PSM\} are necessary. An electronic and special software offers an easy evaluation of the PSM-signals and to specify dose. The dose characteristic is linear from 10Â Î¼Gy up to 10Â Gy. Then supralinearity connected with a change of the shape of the decay curve starts. The saturation begins with some hundred grays. The variation coefficient of dose measurements is below 2% for dose higher than 0.1Â mGy. The energy dependence shows an underestimation of low energy photons. The BeOmax-System can be used in medicine, for industrial applications and for scientific research. Two examples will be shown. },

  Abstract                 = {Feldspars are an attractive alternative to quartz for extending the dose range, and for dating volcanic terrains such as on Mars and Iceland. Unfortunately, charge stored in the feldspar lattice undergoes anomalous fading leading to an underestimation in the dose estimates. In this paper we use the time-resolved optically stimulated luminescence (TR-OSL) technique to investigate the processes that give rise to the signal following infrared (IR), green and blue stimulation, with an objective to understand tunnelling and charge transport during thermo-optical excitations. We show that the TR-OSL shape is governed by the energy of excitation and the subsequent charge recombination route through the excited state of the trap, the band tail states or the conduction band. The role of band tail states in charge recombination is specifically examined using the signal shown to decay over several ms; we identify two dominant recombination routes, viz., phonon (0.05â0.06Â eV) assisted diffusion, and quantum mechanical tunnelling, depending on the energy state of the detrapped electron. As would be expected, diffusion in the band tails is identical for both resonant and non-resonant excitations, where in the latter case the band tail state occupancy likely arises from thermalisation of conduction band electrons. The important outcome of this study is a comprehensive physical model based on a single dosimetric trap that successfully explains wide-ranging luminescence phenomena in feldspars, in particular, the luminescence efficiency and thermal partitioning of charge in different energy states and the subsequent recombination routes. The model predicts three different systematic approaches to preferentially sampling the most stable signal. We finally present evidence for a non-fading signal using one of these methods based on pulsed \{IR\} stimulation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We extend the localised transition model based on randomly varying recombination distances (Jain et al., 2012) to include Arrhenius analysis and truncated nearest neighbour distributions. The model makes important predictions regarding a) the physical understanding of the linear intercepts in the Arrhenius analysis for localised recombination systems and b) the relationship between charge depletion and shape of the luminescence decay curves; these predictions are successfully tested by experimental investigations. We demonstrate that this model successfully describes the kinetic behaviour, both thermal and optical, of the infrared stimulated luminescence signal from feldspar. Based on the application of this model, it is concluded that different infra-red stimulated luminescence emissions (UV, blue, yellow and far-red) follow the same kinetics, and, therefore, involve participation of the same electron (dosimetric) trap. The differences in thermal stabilities of the different emissions results from differences in number densities of the recombination sites. The results have implications for understanding the mechanism of the far-red emission, and the spatial distributions of recombination sites in feldspar. },

  Abstract                 = {Naturally occurring radioactive material in containerized cargo challenges the state of the art in national and international efforts to detect illicit nuclear and radiological material in transported containers. Current systems are being evaluated and new systems envisioned to provide the high probability of detection necessary to thwart potential threats, combined with extremely low nuisance and false alarm rates necessary to maintain the flow of commerce impacted by the enormous volume of commodities imported in shipping containers. Maintaining flow of commerce also means that inspection must be rapid, requiring relatively non-intrusive, indirect measurements of cargo from outside containers to the extent possible. With increasing information content in such measurements, it is natural to ask how the information might be combined to improve detection. Toward this end, we present an approach to estimating isotopic activity of naturally occurring radioactive material in cargo grouped by commodity type, combining container manifest data with radiography and gamma-ray spectroscopy aligned to location along the container. The heart of this approach is our statistical model of gamma-ray counts within peak regions of interest, which captures the effects of background suppression, counting noise, convolution of neighboring cargo contributions, and down-scattered photons to provide estimates of counts due to decay of specific radioisotopes in cargo alone. Coupled to that model, we use a mechanistic model of self-attenuated radiation flux to estimate the isotopic activity within cargo, segmented by location within each container, that produces those counts. We test our approach by applying it to a set of measurements taken at the Port of Seattle in 2006. This approach to synthesizing disparate available data streams and extraction of cargo characteristics, while relying on several simplifying assumptions and approximations, holds the potential to support improvement of detection systems using current capabilities and to enable simulation-based evaluation of new candidate detection systems. },

However, the \{DTC\} conversion method is still an effective assay method to calculate the radioisotope inventory because of the simple and easy procedures to be applied. In order to make the \{DTC\} conversion method practical, numerous assumptions and limitations placed on its use. These assumptions and limitations are related to the dose rate measurement and the relative abundance of gamma emitters in a drum. However, these two variables were generally obtained from the different detection mechanisms even using the different radwaste each other. Unfortunately, that expanded the limitation of using the \{DTC\} conversion method. In order to obtain two variables in a drum to be assayed at once, the dose conversion factor for a NaI(Tl) detector was first calculated from the \{MCNP\} code. The pulse height spectrum from a simulated drum inserted into a standard source was measured by a NaI(Tl) detector, and then, two variables were calculated from the dose conversion factor and the net count rate of detected gamma emitters in the pulse height spectrum. },

After optimization, this \{LSC\} procedure allows the determination of 131I activities with a limit of detection (CCÎ²) of 11Â mBqÂ kgâ1. The procedure was successfully validated by comparison with the \{ISO\} 10703:2007 normative and requires both less sample volume and measurement time than the standard procedure. The method has been applied to the monitoring of 131I in the \{STP\} of Valladolid (Spain), which found activities below the maximum allowed by legislation and showed a near constant background 131I activity in the influents with punctual increases corresponding to authorized spills. The mean 131I removing efficiency of the \{STP\} was 52%. },

  Abstract                 = {Hungary is rich in underground waters such as thermal, mineral, and spring waters. A survey was carried out to study the naturally occurring alpha emitter radionuclides in popular and regularly consumed spring waters in the Balaton Upland region of Hungary and significant levels of radioactivity were found. Thirty samples were analyzed for gross alpha and beta activity concentrations by the low background gas flow proportional counter. The activity concentrations ranging from 26 to 1749Â mBqÂ dmâ3 and from 33 to 2015Â mBqÂ dmâ3 for gross alpha and beta, respectively, were observed in the spring waters. In general, the gross beta activity was higher than the alpha activity concentration. According to the results obtained, elevated level of Total Indicative Dose (TID) might be expected due to spring water consumption. In some cases, total dose might exceed the 100Â Î¼SvÂ yâ1 reference level recommended by WHO. The data obtained can provide an important information for the consumers and the authorities regarding the preliminary dose exposure risk due to spring water intake. },

  Abstract                 = {For the first time kinetic parameters of thulium doped Lithium calcium borate (LCB) Thermoluminescence (TL) material are reported here. Irradiated LCB:Tm3+ powder has revealed two intense \{TL\} glow peaks one at 510 (peak 1) and the other at 660 K (peak 2). Activation energy (E), frequency factor (s) and order of kinetics (b) of these peaks were determined by various heating rate (VHR), initial rise (IR), and peak shape (PS) methods. The trap depth and frequency factor determined for peaks 1 and 2 of LCB:Tm phosphor using \{VHR\} and \{IR\} methods are in good agreement. The average activation energy of peaks 1 and 2 obtained by these methods is 1.62 and 1.91 eV respectively. The frequency factors of peaks 1 and 2 are in the range of 1013â16 and 1012â14 secâ1 respectively. The E and s values estimated using the glow peak shape dependent parameters are relatively less compared to the values obtained from other methods. The large difference in these values is due to the complex nature of the glow curves. The order of the kinetics process for complex glow curve peaks could not be assigned on the basis of shape parameters alone but Tm response on absorbed dose is to be considered for final confirmation. Glow peaks 1 and 2 of LCB:Tm3+ obey first and general order kinetics respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {222Rn activity in soil gas was measured across fault segments of the seismic active Ventaniella Fault and the seismic inactive Sabero-GordÃ³n Fault in the Cantabrian Mountains, \{NW\} Spain, in order to investigate the variability of the 222Rn concentration. The sampling took place in summer and autumn 2010. During the autumn measurement program, an additional 222Rn soil gas mapping was carried out in the Sabero-GordÃ³n research area. Zones of elevated 222Rn activity in the soil gas were identified by background 222Rn values of the geological formations used for mapping and local background values from 222Rn values outside the elevated 222Rn activity zones. Unexpectedly, the Sabero-GordÃ³n Fault showed higher 222Rn activity, up to 441 kBqmâ3, compared to the 222Rn activity of the Ventaniella Fault which had a maximum of 106 kBqmâ3. Comparison of the results shows that the values measured in summer are about 5 times higher than the autumn values. This difference is not reflected in petrophysical soil parameters or meteorological conditions documented during the field measurements. Based on the results of our work we conclude that the magnitude of 222Rn concentration in soil gas is not an indicator of local seismic activity of the investigated faults. For the studied segment of the aseismic Sabero-GordÃ³n Fault we suggest active genesis of pathways for gas migration driven by aseismic fault slip causing the elevated 222Rn activity in soil gas. },

  Abstract                 = {This study presents the preliminary results of investigation of the types and dynamics of paramagnetic centres in lime mortars from Sveta Petka church in Budinjak, Croatia, using Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The excavation in Budinjak discovered a very unique four lobed plan object Sveta Petka, with no additional finds or reliable historical records about the time of its construction. The lime mortars from the church were chosen for analysis in order to characterize the building material and to verify the site chronology by dating them. Lime mortar is valuable but problematic material for luminescence and radiocarbon dating. This type of material has not been dated before using ESR; therefore, careful studies are required to identify the useful paramagnetic centres. The \{ESR\} approach suggested in this work concentrates on a calcium carbonate signal. All samples were Î³-irradiated in 60C bomb with the doses of 1, 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100 kGy. In all spectra signals from Fe3+ and Mn2+ ions have been observed. Paramagnetic centres which give the \{ESR\} signals may be interpreted as CO2â, CO3â, CO33â, HCO32â, SO2â, SO3â, PO2â and PO32â species. However, all spectra are complex and signals are interfering; therefore, computer resolution enhancement method will be needed in further research. The changes in \{ESR\} signals amplitude measured at magnetic field range about 3440â3450 G were analysed versus the dose of irradiation, using Mn2+ signals as a reference. Exponential growth of the curve and saturation for doses above 20 kGy were observed; therefore, irradiation with smaller doses is required. These preliminary studies will be helpful in future attempts of dating lime mortars by \{ESR\} method. },

It is shown that when evaluating doses in a water phantom, the type-a algorithm provides dose predictions which are accurate to within clinically relevant criteria, Î³(3%,3Â mm), but these predictions are nonetheless subtly different from the results of evaluating doses from the same fields using radiochromic film and Monte Carlo simulations. An analysis of a clinical meningioma treatment suggests that when predicting stereotactic radiotherapy doses to the brain, the inaccuracies of the type-a algorithm can be exacerbated by inadequate evaluation of the effects of nearby bone or air, resulting in dose differences of up to 10% for individual fields. The results of this study indicate the possible advantage of using Monte Carlo calculations, as well as measurements with high-spatial-resolution media, to verify type-a predictions of dose delivered in cranial treatments. },

The neutron flux incident on the target was measured with a 238U fission ionization chamber. Protons emitted from the target were measured with three ÎEâE detectors consisting of a thin \{NE102A\} scintillator and a thick \{NE213\} liquid scintillator. In the analysis, the pulse shape discrimination of the \{NE213\} scintillator enable us to distinguish events for a charged particle stopping in the scintillator from events for a charged particle penetrating the scintillator. Experimental results were compared with calculations by the \{PHITS\} code coupled with the JENDL-HE file, the Bertini model implemented in the \{PHITS\} code, and the \{PEANUT\} model in the \{FLUKA\} code. },

Measurements studied a response of a single strip on the synchrotron microbeam in face-on and edge-on modes using \{CMRP\} designed and developed readout electronics for a parallel readout of single strips. Measurements were done in a passive mode without bias voltage and the detector was scanned through an array of intensive planar microbeams with the nominal width of 50Â Î¼m. The face-on mode results to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 112Â Î¼m and a peak to valley dose ratio (PVDR) of 12. Charge sharing between the microstrips was observed to be essential due to the high intensity of the microbeams. In the edge-on mode, the measured \{FWHM\} was observed 100Â Î¼m and the \{PVDR\} to 500. Based on the results presented in this paper, the thin microstrip detector is a promising dosimeter for the high spatial resolution dosimetry in synchrotron MRT. },

The proton beams are derived from a thin polyimide target exposed to an high intense Ti:sapphire laser 8Â J energy and 40Â fs duration. The sample sets, stacked radiochromic film and CR-39 detectors covered with 13Â Î¼m aluminum filter, are irradiated under vacuum condition. By analyzing the etch pits on the last layer of CR-39 which recorded etchable tracks, the energies of each proton in high-energy region are evaluated more precisely than in the past. The residual ranges for each particle in the last layer has been obtained from etch pit growth curves with multi-step etching technique. The maximum energy of proton is 14.39Â Â±Â 0.05Â MeV. This method allows us to measure the maximum energy of proton precisely, which can obtain high energy resolution with uncertainty ÎEÂ =Â 0.1Â MeV in the laser-driven particle acceleration experiment. },

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity-corrected multiple-aliquot regenerative-dose (MAR) protocol provides a reliable approach for fine-grained quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. For reliable estimation of the equivalent dose (De), we investigated certain basic experimental parameters in the fine-grained quartz \{MAR\} \{OSL\} dating of Chinese loess. (1) For suitable bleaching of the natural \{OSL\} signal of the regenerative-dose aliquots, the effect of bleaching duration using sunlight, \{SOL2\} and blue \{LEDs\} on De was studied, and it is found that the appropriate method is a short-duration \{SOL2\} (e.g. 5Â min) or blue \{LEDs\} (e.g. 60Â s) bleaching. (2) To select the appropriate test dose, the relationship between the test dose and De was investigated based on three samples having De values of approximately 11, 31 and 137Â Gy respectively. It is suggested that the test dose for sensitivity correction may be limited to less than approximately 10â20Â Gy. (3) Three commonly used fitting modes for quartz \{OSL\} growth curve were compared at three regenerative-dose scales. The results indicate that the mode of two saturating exponential functions plus a constant is appropriate and universal. (4) The comparison of De values derived using \{OSL\} approach with those obtained using the recuperated \{OSL\} (ReOSL) protocol shows that the reliable De estimation in the fine-grained quartz \{MAR\} \{OSL\} dating of Chinese loess may be limited to less than approximately 300Â Gy. (5) The comparison of growth curves for 18 samples from the Weinan, Xifeng and Jingyuan sites shows that it is feasible to construct a standardized growth curve (SGC) for fine-grained quartz \{OSL\} signal in the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). },

The full-energy peaks were characterized in terms of pulse height linearity, resolution, and counting efficiency. Energy spectral resolution also was demonstrated for alpha particles, beta particles, and 239Pu/Be neutrons. Gamma-ray detection efficiency was comparable to a conventional NaI(Tl) detector of similar volume but peak resolution at 662Â keV in this new detector type was currently only 27%, compared to about 7% for the NaI(Tl) detector.

In this method, a âpowder sandwichâ is made by enclosing the powder in between two filter papers in sandwich geometry. This arrangement ensures that the thickness of powder sample is much less than the thoron diffusion length, avoiding any loss of thoron due to matrix absorption and supports complete removal of thoron gas emanated from the powder. The technique utilizes a closed loop setup in which thoron emanated from the powder sandwich is removed using flow through arrangement and is measured using suitable thoron detector. The thoron mass exhalation rate for the powder is estimated using a mass balance model from the measured equilibrium thoron concentration. Subsequently, the thoron emanation coefficient is estimated using the thoron mass exhalation rate and 224Ra content of the powders. The applicability of the methodology has been demonstrated for three different powders. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The counting systems consisting of electronic devices are used for detection of radiation due to X or gamma rays. The dead time of the counting system is based on time limitations of these electronic devices. The dead time causes counting losses. Determination of counting rate losses in quantitative and qualitative analysis become a vital step for correction of analysis. Therefore, compensating for counting rate losses is of great importance. These counting rate losses are due to piled up reject time, paralyzable or non-paralyzable system dead time or a combination of these mechanisms. Paralyzable and non-paralyzable models are well-known and frequently used for correction of counting rate losses dependent on the system dead time. However, these two models do not provide enough correction at medium and high counting rates. Therefore, the new models for corrections of counting rate losses are needed. For this reason, both an alternative approach is proposed and a simulation program is coded for counting rate losses in this study. A good agreement is obtained between theoretical model and simulation program. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Feldspars are natural radiation dosimeters used in geological dating. The processes that underlie the measured natural- and laboratory induced infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals are, however, not fully understood. In this study we aim to determine the optical depth of the electron trap that is used in luminescence dating. A series of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) experiments were performed on two feldspar minerals (single-crystal museum specimens of Na- and K-feldspar) at a low temperature (10Â K). The low temperature suppresses thermal processes that may be active during excitation and facilitates the monitoring of mainly optical transitions. Additional experiments at room temperature were performed for comparison. The continuous wave \{OSL\} and the post-stimulation phosphorescence were recorded in the ultra violet (3.2â4.8Â eV) for stimulation energies ranging between 1.7 and 2.8Â eV. From the dependence of the \{OSL\} intensity on the excitation energy is deduced that band-tail states play a significant role during charge transport, thus complicating the precise determination of the optical trap depth. Both minerals display a small resonant transition when stimulated at â¼2.05Â eV. From the \{OSL\} data, the trap depth is tentatively estimated to be â¼2.1 and â¼2.5Â eV for Na- and K-feldspar, respectively. The fast phosphorescence following \{IRSL\} in both crystals is likely the result of tunnelling from band-tail states in the vicinity of the excited state of the IR-trap. The post-OSL phosphorescence decay is an order of magnitude slower, owing to the contribution from tunnelling of charge from a range of occupied band-tail states. The lack of dependence of the phosphorescence decay rate on the excitation energy (in the range of 1.7â2.8Â eV), unambiguously indicates that a single mechanism causes the post-OSL phosphorescence signal. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Accurate estimation of the radiation released at incidents, such as nuclear accidents or radiological terrorist events is of major importance for the prediction of health effects following such an incident. The luminescence properties of several materials are studied in order to assess their potential use as dosimeters in such cases. However, the protocols followed for such purposes are mainly those initially developed for dating. Multiple-aliquot protocols are mainly based on the Thermoluminescence response of the dosimeter used and require the availability of abundant material, while homogeneity of the luminescent substance in the entire sample is also a prerequisite in order to prepare similar aliquots. To account for the above drawbacks, several single-aliquot protocols have been suggested based on Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL), which however involve steps of heating the sample up to 300Â Â°C, and as a result they can only be used for heat-resistant materials. In the present work, a novel single aliquot regenerative-dose protocol suitable for heat-sensitive materials exhibiting sensitization (called SARHS) for the estimation of the equivalent dose with \{OSL\} is proposed. The protocol eliminates any sensitization effects without encompassing any heating of the sample. Validation of the \{SARHS\} protocol was accomplished with three different heat-sensitive materials which exhibit sensitivity changes with the repeated use of the same sample (sensitization), i.e., dragonfly wings, a commercial solid drug (Daktarin) and chicken bones, in which the natural equivalent dose could be successfully recovered with negligible error even when fading, after exposure to irradiation, of the natural \{OSL\} signal was taken into account. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Rare earth doped CaSO4 materials are well known thermoluminescent dosimeters with friendly properties. They are used in the practice for a long while. New phosphors based on CaSO4:Tm were synthesized using a modified preparation method for adding Cu as co-dopant. The produced materials have several favorable new characteristics. Larger linear dose response range, simpler glow-curve structure and a small diminution in the sensitivity are the consequences of the copper addition. Trapping efficiency of samples containing different amounts of Tm and Cu was investigated as the function of the composition using a consecutive RL/TL measuring technique. It was cleared up that the Cu addition, depending on its amount, reduced this value. This plays the main role in the sensitivity loss and forms one of the factors in the explanation of the linear dose range widening. },

  Abstract                 = {The stem signal, composed of fluorescence and Äerenkov light, becomes a significant source of uncertainty in fiber-coupled afterloaded brachytherapy dosimetry when the source dwells near the fiber cable but far from the detector. A stem suppression technique originally developed for scintillators was adapted for on-line in-vivo dosimetry using fiber-coupled carbon doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C). The technique involved a two-channel optical filtration of the radioluminescence (RL) emitted from a pre-irradiated Al2O3:C crystal with enhanced sensitivity. The system responded linearly in the absorbed dose range 0.05â50Â Gy, as needed under high dose rate (HDR) conditions. The dosimeter was irradiated in a water phantom using a 37Â GBq 192Ir source at source-to-crystal distances ranging from 0.5Â cm to 6.7Â cm. For irradiation conditions that generated a stem component in the range 4%â15% in the unfiltered signal, and up to 5Â Â±Â 1% in a single-channel read-out optimized for Al2O3:C, the adapted stem suppression technique reduced the stem component toÂ â1Â Â±Â 3%. The stem suppressed dosimeter response and the 192Ir source depth dose curve agreed within position uncertainties, and with a 5% maximum deviation, for distances up to 6Â cm. },

  Abstract                 = {Cutouts, which are used as field-shaping shield, affect several electron beam parameters. These effects are more observable for small field sizes and high energy electron beams. Owing to the fact that small fields prevent the lateral scatter equilibrium, at higher energies larger field radius is required for the establishment of lateral equilibrium. The profile curves are derived from circular, triangular, and square cutout shapes and size placed in a 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 electron applicator. These profile curves are obtained using parallel plane type ion chamber at the R100, R90, \{R80\} and \{R50\} depths. Correspondingly, the source surface distance is 100Â cm. In this study \{MCNP\} Monte Carlo (MC) simulation was used to compare Percentage Depth Dose (PDD) and Profile of electron beams. Monte Carlo and measured results showed a good compliance for \{PDD\} and beam profile. The measurements and calculations showed that as the field width decreases, the Flatness and Penumbra Ratio also decreases. In other words, flatter plateau was available for larger fields. Also the Coverage Ratio for each of the profiles is presented. The flatness and symmetry values for triangle shapes were greater than the two other shapes. Knowledge of these changes are significant in radiation therapy. Accordingly, a comparison between the Monte Carlo data and the measured results can be beneficial for treatment simulation and development of treatment planning systems. },

  Abstract                 = {In a track counting system a digital \{USB\} \{CCD\} camera is often used to make a communication between the visually seen etched tracks of a solid state nuclear track detector and the image analyzer software installed on the PC. The camera's characteristics determine the size of the image, and the number of pixels per track. The resolution and contrast of the images are the key features in how well an image analyzer can perform the task of track measurement. In this paper we present an approach to increase the resolution and contrast of the images, aiming to extract the features which cannot be simply attained from the original image. The presented algorithm as an image processing technique is used to replace the economical cost of high quality imaging system with the computational cost of image processing. The tracks' characteristics will remain intact and the contrast of the image will be enhanced through Shannon entropy reaching its maximum. Feature preservation is done through maximizing the similarity between the original low resolution image and the processed higher resolution image. Similarity is defined as the mutual information between two images. This resolution increment will result in contrast enhancement and increased information transfer for feature extraction purpose. Experimental images of alpha tracks taken by a 350KP \{USB\} digital camera are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. },

Images of the detectors' surfaces are input to the code, which generates text and figure files as output, including the number of counted etched tracks with the associated track parameters, histograms and a figure showing edge and center of detected etched tracks. \{ATMS\} code is running hierarchically as calibration, testing and measurement modes to demonstrate the reliability, repeatability and adaptability. Fuzzy Hough Transform is used for the estimation of the number of etched tracks and their parameters, providing results even in cases that overlapping and orientation occur. \{ATMS\} code is finally converted to a standalone file which makes it able to run out of \{MATLAB\} environment. },

  Abstract                 = {Photoluminescence (PL), thermoluminescence (TL) and mechanoluminescence (ML) of rare-earths (RE) doped BaSO4 and MgSO4 phosphors were studied. Undoped and doped phosphors containing different concentrations of dopant were synthesized by solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the samples matched well with their standard data of Joint Committee on Powder Diffractionâs (JCPD) file. In the \{PL\} spectrum of Dy doped samples, peaks around 470 and 580Â nm were observed due to transition of Dy3+ ion. Eu doped BaSO4 showed \{PL\} peak at 380Â nm due to transition of Eu2+ ion, however, in the \{PL\} spectrum of MgSO4:Eu phosphors, transition of Eu3+ was also observed along with transition of Eu2+ ion. Dy doped Î³-ray-irradiated BaSO4 and MgSO4 phosphors showed at least two distinct peaks in their \{TL\} glow curves. The first peak occurred in range 120â150Â Â°C and the second peak was observed in the range 220â230Â Â°C. The \{TL\} glow curve of Î³-ray-irradiated BaSO4:Eu contained a distinct peak at 170Â Â°C. Two distinct peaks, one at 110Â Â°C and another at 220Â Â°C were observed in the \{TL\} glow curve of Î³-ray-irradiated MgSO4:Eu phosphors. \{TL\} spectra showed that \{RE\} ions act as luminescence centre in BaSO4 and MgSO4 system. When the \{ML\} was excited impulsively by dropping a load on to the Î³-ray-irradiated samples, only one sharp peak was observed in the \{ML\} intensity versus time curve of Dy doped samples, however, two peaks were observed in the \{ML\} intensity versus time curve of Eu doped BaSO4 and MgSO4 phosphors. The \{ML\} spectra of samples showed the characteristic emission of rare-earth impurities. Experimental results suggest that although almost similar states are responsible for PL, \{TL\} and ML, the luminescence efficiency of the phosphors depends on the mode of excitation. },

Calibration and consequently the accuracy of the system can be influenced when a number of important system parameters such as pipe diameter, source to detector distance and so on are changed from one case to another. In this work an Artificial Neural Network model was proposed for developing a previously designed and constructed gamma ray densitometer in prediction of fluid density of different petroleum products. The required data for training and testing the \{ANN\} model has been obtained based on simulations using \{MCNP4C\} Monte Carlo code. Simulations for 4-inch polyethylene pipe had been validated with the experimental data previously. The Mean Relative Error (MRE) from \{ANN\} modeling was less than 0.5%. Results show that proposed \{ANN\} model represents a good estimation of the density in petroleum products monitoring application and can be used as a reliable and accurate tool. },

Data were used from radiation accident victims overexposed to doses ranging from 0.2 to 8.5Â Gy and who were cytogenetically followed-up for various times upto 50Â y. Their cultured lymphocytes had been scored both by the conventional dicentric method and by \{FISH\} for all translocations involving painted chromosomes (2, 3, 8); (2, 3, 5) or (2, 4, 12). The inÂ vivo dose response relationship was derived by fitting translocation frequencies to the contemporary individual doses obtained independently and confirmed by different biological assays and physical dosimetry. A comparison with the conventional inÂ vitro curve indicates reductions of translocation frequencies with increasing time which would prejudice retrospective dose assessment by FISH. This has led to the possibility to amend the inÂ vitro dose response curve for translocations to make it more suitable for use in retrospective biodosimetry. This approach for retrospective biodosimetry therefore uses a dose response relationship based on truly persisting translocations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the standard \{OSL\} dating procedure, the \{OSL\} signal is measured at 125Â Â°C. For quartz samples from bricks the presence of traps responsible for the 160Â Â°C and 200Â Â°C \{TL\} peaks has an influence on the \{OSL\} process, just like the one for the traps responsible for the 110Â Â°C \{TL\} peak. In order to examine the significance of this disturbance for dating results, a series of measurements of De was carried out for various temperatures of the \{OSL\} readout in \{SAR\} protocol. For most samples, significant fluctuations of De values were obtained, especially at temperatures above 90Â Â°C. Also the analysis of \{OSL\} components carried out for curves obtained at different measurement temperatures shows that the \{TL\} traps active up to 200Â Â°C make the \{OSL\} process more complex. The measurement at 125Â Â°C does not assure the exclusion of shallow traps from the \{OSL\} process. A reasonable solution of this problem may be the choice of temperatures below the range of dominant \{TL\} peaks, in the \{SAR\} protocol for \{OSL\} measurements. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Quartz is the mineral most commonly used for sediment dating. In dating practice, the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of quartz is measured mainly using the stimulation light whose wavelength is 470Â Â±Â 30Â nm. The parameters of traps active in the \{OSL\} process are also determined for this stimulation band. The zeroing of the \{OSL\} is the fundamental condition of applicability of the luminescence dating for specific sediment and takes place in sunlight whose spectrum differs significantly from the band 470Â Â±Â 30Â nm. In order to be able to know the course of \{OSL\} process in nature, a wider knowledge of the dependency of the trap parameters on the stimulation band is needed. Here the results are presented for the \{OSL\} measurements carried out with different wavelengths of stimulation light. For each stimulation band the components of the \{OSL\} signal are determined by the fitting procedure, and in this way the wavelength dependence of an individual component is found. The experiment has been repeated for two temperatures of \{OSL\} detection â the room temperature, which corresponds to natural conditions, and for 125Â Â°C, which is the temperature usually applied for \{OSL\} measurement in dating. Four \{OSL\} components are presented in both experimental series. The values of their optical cross-section changes along with stimulation energy and temperature, as it is predicted by the model of \{OSL\} process including crystal lattice vibrations. },

A considerable change in this value appears in the temperature region from 80 to 140Â Â°C that is known for high complexity in \{OSL\} processes in quartz. Our observations suggest that the variation in the obtained results at least partly is caused by the laboratory procedure used when the natural \{OSL\} signal is measured.

  Abstract                 = {Various organic scintillators are commonly used as the detecting material for neutrons, but these detectors are less sensitive to gamma rays. In particular, stilbene crystals and \{BC501A\} (NE213, EJ301) have good pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) between neutron and gamma-ray events, and have been selected as the media for fast-neutron detection among the organic, inorganic and plastic materials in a mixed radiation field. Although some of the scintillation characteristics of stilbene crystals have been studied, the detailed scintillation characteristics of the crystal are not completely understood. In this study, the light yield, decay time and pulse shape discrimination capability of a stilbene crystal were measured because this crystal is an optimized detector in a large flux of neutrons such as those might be found in cyclotron and charged particle accelerator facilities. The pulse-shape discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays with a stilbene crystal was measured using a 252Cf neutron source at room temperature. A neutron tagger module was used for the neutron and gamma separation using the charge comparison method in real time. The total pulse width for the charge integration and the delay from the peak-to tail start time were optimized for a better neutron and gamma separation. The relative light yield and decay time of the stilbene crystal scintillator were also measured. },

  Abstract                 = {Neutron dosimetery continues to remain an important and a challenging aspect of radiation protection due to the higher biological effectiveness of neutrons than that of gamma rays and the intricacy in the responses of the detectors. The need for personal dosimetry in mixed fields of neutrons and gamma rays has considerably increased due to the rising number of nuclear facilities, nuclear power plants, medical therapy equipment, accelerators and so on. The most widely used technique for personal dosimetry has been the albedo technique employing pairs of neutron sensitive 6LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-600) and neutron insensitive 7LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-700) thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Off late, LiF:Mg,Cu,Si has emerged as one of the most promising \{TLD\} material, having the advantages of high sensitivity, near tissue equivalence to gamma rays, negligible fading on pre and post-irradiation storage, thermal stability for readout and negligible residual signal after the readout. In this study, neutron energy response of indigenously developed 6LiF:Mg,Cu,Si and 7LiF:Mg,Cu,Si \{TLD\} pairs was evaluated to neutrons of energy from thermal to 11.6Â MeV and was compared with the response of TLD-600 and TLD-700 pairs. The net \{TL\} per unit neutron dose for the 6LiF:Mg,Cu,Si/7LiF:Mg,Cu,Si \{TLD\} pair was found to be about 10 times of that of the TLD-600/TLD-700 pair. Unlike, TLD-600 and TLD-700, the glow curve structure of 6LiF:Mg,Cu,Si and 7LiF:Mg,Cu,Si remained almost the same for all the irradiations. Thus, 6LiF:Mg,Cu,Si and 7LiF:Mg,Cu,Si \{TLDs\} provided a better alternate to TLD-600 and TLD-700 for the dosimetry of mixed fields of neutrons and gamma rays. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Investigations of bleaching and thermoluminescence (TL) response to radiation dose of quartz are importance in luminescence dating. Although such research has been extensively carried out for various types of quartz, most work was performed on the basis of \{TL\} intensity integrated for a particular temperature range on the glow curve, without any peak separation. In this study we investigated bleaching by a blue light stimulation and radiation dose behaviour for separated \{TL\} glow peaks of quartz, which are thermally stable, by using the computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) method combined with the TmâTstop method. The TmâTstop method indicates that the glow curve of quartz is the superposition of at least seven components (P1âP7) in the temperature range between room temperature and 450Â Â°C. A bleaching experiment for four thermally stable glow peaks (P4âP7) using a blue light stimulation revealed that the bleaching rate of peak \{P4\} exhibits three different exponential decays, whereas the peaks P5, \{P6\} and \{P7\} are bleached with two different exponential decays. After bleaching of 12Â h, the \{TL\} intensity of peaks P4, P5, \{P6\} and \{P7\} were reduced to approximately 6%, 16%, 26% and 68% of the initial value, respectively. Additionally, in a study of the radiation dose response of the four thermally stable glow peaks, all peaks have a similar pattern, which are well fitted by a single saturating exponential function. },

Physical characteristics, natural lifetime, thermal quenching activation energy ÎE, and thermal assistance activation energy Ea were firstly determined. From the results of the investigation of dependence on dose and dose rate of X-ray radiation using fully bleached samples, the lifetime decreased significantly to about 20Â Î¼s; when the X-ray dose was increased to 300Â Gy at a dose rate of 0.5Â Gy/s. Also, despite different radiation dose rates, at a dose of 50Â Gy both lifetime and related intensity were independent of dose rate change. },

  Abstract                 = {Environmental gamma-ray dose rates were measured by using ultra-high sensitive LiF:Mg,Cu,Si thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) during short-term burial. The resultant gamma-ray dose rates were compared with those measured by using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of Al2O3:C and assessed by using \{HPGe\} spectrometer. Regardless of the short-term burial and the change of environmental conditions as well as the mismatch of the effective atomic number (Zeff) with the soil (mainly SiO2), good agreement was observed between the doses measured by \{TLDs\} and \{OSL\} dosimeters or the assessed doses. LiF:Mg,Cu,Si \{TLD\} has been found to be an effective alternative for the measurement of environmental gamma-ray annual dose rates for use in optical dating. },

Protons were selected for implantation to mimic the effect of natural radiation over geological timescales. All samples exhibited depletion in the UVâviolet emission (3.2â3.4Â eV) with increasing cumulative dose, whilst the red emission (1.8â1.9Â eV) increased. A powerâlaw relationship exists between the two emissions.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Trapped-charge dating methods including luminescence and electron spin resonance dating have high potential as low temperature (&lt; 100 Â°C) thermochronometers. Despite an early proof of concept almost 60 years ago, it is only in the past two decades that thermoluminescence (TL), electron-spin-resonance (ESR), and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), have begun to gain momentum in geological thermochronometry and thermometry applications. Here we review the physics of trapped-charge dating, the studies that led to its development and its first applications for deriving palaeo-temperatures and/or continuous cooling histories. Analytical protocols, which enable the derivation of sample specific kinetic parameters over laboratory timescales, are also described. The key limitation of trapped-charge thermochronometry is signal saturation, which sets an upper limit of its application to &lt; 1 Ma, thus restricting it to rapidly exhuming terrains (&gt; 200 Â°C Maâ 1), or elevated-temperature underground settings (&gt; 30 Â°C). Despite this limitation, trapped-charge thermochronometry comprises a diverse suite of versatile methods, and we explore potential future applications and research directions. },

The analysis is based on single \{TL\} glow-peak analytical expressions derived for the \{EHF\} cases. A special normalization procedure is suggested which allows the deconvolution of very different glow-curves using the same set of the initial parameters during the \{CGCD\} analysis. More than two hundreds of glow-curves corresponding to \{TL\} measurements for dose response, for quality control, for low \{TL\} statistics, for background and finally glow-curves with undesired spurious signals. The results show that the \{CGCD\} analysis, which is widely used in the case of linear heating, can be used and be equally effective for the case of \{EHF\} as well. },

  Abstract                 = {Athermal or anomalous fading (AF) is one of the most serious problems in thermoluminescence (TL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Several possible ways have been suggested for choosing a non-fading signal in feldspars, including high temperature thermal preconditioning of the samples. The aim of the present work is to search for stable \{OSL\} signals in Durango apatite, a material which exhibits very strong \{AF\} effects, by focusing on the existence of optically sensitive very deep traps (VDT). These are traps which are responsible for \{TL\} peaks above 500Â Â°C. Two experimental protocols are used to establish the optimal stimulation temperature for these \{OSL\} signals from VDT, in order to estimate the activation energy for these signals, and to study their \{AF\} properties. It is found that the \{OSL\} signals from \{VDT\} are more stable than conventional signals from traps responsible for \{TL\} peaks below 500Â Â°C, and that they exhibit smaller anomalous fading effects. A new luminescence signal is reported in this material, consisting of a long-lived luminescence decay, observed after the end of short 1Â s optical pulses. This new relaxation signal is observed after both blue light stimulation and infrared stimulation of the sample. },

  Abstract                 = {Thermoluminescence (TL), linear modulated-optically stimulated luminescence (LM-OSL) and continuous-wave optically stimulated luminescence (CW-OSL) are very well-established techniques for dosimetry of ionizing radiation as well as archaeological and geological dating. The simplest phenomenological model describing all these techniques is the one-trap-one recombination center model (OTOR). The differential equations describing the \{OTOR\} model can-not be solved analytically; therefore, the TL, LM-OSL and CW-OSL experimental results are treated through various analytical expressions, with the most general expression being empirical. In the present study, computational mathematics provides the tools to find a semi-analytical solution for the \{OTOR\} model thus deriving a general equation, which can provide elementary model peaks for any luminescence stimulation mode described by the \{OTOR\} model. The new general, semi-analytical expression was tested using reference curves derived using the numerical solution of the \{OTOR\} model. In the case of \{TL\} and LM-OSL, new conditions for the maximum were obtained and compared with the results of general order kinetics. Finally, an initial trial to convert the semi-analytical general expression into a purely analytical solution is also discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a plastic scintillation detector (PSD) incorporated into a prostate immobilization device to verify doses inÂ vivo delivered during intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated-arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer. The treatment plans for both modalities had been developed for a patient undergoing prostate radiation therapy. First, a study was performed to test the dependence, if any, of \{PSD\} accuracy on the number and type of calibration conditions. This study included \{PSD\} measurements of each treatment plan being delivered under quality assurance (QA) conditions using a rigid \{QA\} phantom. \{PSD\} results obtained under these conditions were compared to ionization chamber measurements. After an optimal set of calibration factors had been found, the \{PSD\} was combined with a commercial endorectal balloon used for rectal distension and prostate immobilization during external beam radiotherapy. This PSD-enhanced endorectal balloon was placed inside of a deformable anthropomorphic phantom designed to simulate male pelvic anatomy. \{PSD\} results obtained under these so-called âsimulated treatment conditionsâ were compared to doses calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS). With the \{PSD\} still inserted in the pelvic phantom, each plan was delivered once again after applying a shift of 1Â cm anterior to the original isocenter to simulate a treatment setup error. The mean total accumulated dose measured using the \{PSD\} differed the TPS-calculated doses by less than 1% for both treatment modalities simulated treatment conditions using the pelvic phantom. When the isocenter was shifted, the \{PSD\} results differed from the \{TPS\} calculations of mean dose by 1.2% (for IMRT) and 10.1% (for VMAT); in both cases, the doses were within the dose range calculated over the detector volume for these regions of steep dose gradient. Our results suggest that the system could benefit prostate cancer patient treatment by providing accurate inÂ vivo dose reports during treatment and verify in real-time whether treatments are being delivered according to the prescribed plan. },

The portable system described herein is based on the pulsed optically stimulated luminescence of a carbon-doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C) single-crystal dosimeter, and was tested using two radionuclides relevant to environmental radiation monitoring, namely 226Ra in liquid form and 232Th. The system was calibrated against NIST-traceable sources, and the minimum detectable dose was found to be â¼3Â Î¼Gy. Also, Monte Carlo calculations based on the 226Ra experimental geometry showed close agreement (2%) with the measured dose value. We conclude that the system described has potential utility as a sensitive, low-level monitoring device suitable for in-situ measurements of environmental gamma radiation levels. },

Since the thermoluminescence in LiF was found to be dependent on the proper combination of dopants, the investigation of the concentration and type of dopants is very important in developing and characterisation of new \{TL\} materials. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of type and concentration of activators on the glow curve structure, sensitivity, reproducibility and on the photon energy response of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si detectors. The energy response was studied in air and on the \{ISO\} water phantom in the range of mean photon energies between 33Â keV and 164Â keV. The morphology and local chemical composition of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si detectors were examined using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results show that type and concentration of activators influence the glow curve and sensitivity. Different dopant concentrations did not show influence on the photon energy response. The sensitivity of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si detector with dopant concentration of MgÂ =Â 0.35Â mol%, CuÂ =Â 0.025Â mol% and SiÂ =Â 0.9Â mol% was very high (up to 65 times higher than that of TLD-100).

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Dosimetry methods outside the target volume are still not well established in radiotherapy. Luminescence detectors due to their small dimensions, very good sensitivity, well known dose and energy response are considered as an interesting approach in verification of doses outside the treated region. The physical processes of thermoluminescence (TL), radiophotoluminescence (RPL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) are very similar and can be described in terms of the energy band model of electron-hole production following irradiation. This work is a review of the main dosimetric characteristics of luminescence detectors which were used in experiments performed by \{EURADOS\} Working Group 9 for in-phantom measurements of secondary radiation (scattered and leakage photons). \{TL\} LiF:Mg,Ti detectors type MTS-7 (IFJ PAN, Poland), types TLD-100 and TLD-700 (Harshaw), \{OSL\} Al2O3:C detectors type nanoDotâ¢ (Landauer Inc.) and \{RPL\} rod glass elements type GD-352M (Asahi Techno Glass Coorporation) are described. The main characteristics are discussed, together with the readout and calibration procedures which lead to a determination of absorbed dose to water. All dosimeter types used show very good uniformity, batch reproducibility and homogeneity. For improved accuracy, individual sensitivity correction factors should be applied for \{TL\} and \{OSL\} dosimeters while for \{RPL\} dosimeters there is no need for individual sensitivity corrections. The dose response of all dosimeters is linear for a wide range of doses. The energy response of GD-352M type dosimeters (with Sn filter) used for out-of-field measurements is flat for medium and low energy X-rays. The energy dependence for \{TLDs\} is low across the range of photon energies used and the energy correction was neglected. A significant over response of Al2O3:C \{OSLDs\} irradiated in kilovoltage photon beams was taken into account. The energy correction factor fen was calculated by using the 2006 \{PENELOPE\} Monte Carlo code. With suitable calibration, all dosimeter types are appropriate for out-of-field dose measurements as well as for the in-phantom measurements of radiotherapy \{MV\} X-rays beams. },

  Abstract                 = {A neutron irradiation system for boron neutron capture therapy using accelerators with an online dose monitoring system was studied for the possible practical implementation of hospital-based BNCT. For this purpose the neutrons produced by the near threshold 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction, i.e. an incident proton energy of around 1.90Â MeV, have suitable properties. Such as the maximum energy below 100Â keV and mostly forward-directed. A good candidate material to shield gamma rays from the Li-target was Lead and the suitable boron-dose enhancer was polyethylene. The optimum physical dimensions and configuration of the irradiation system was determined using the concept of treatbale protocol depth as figures of merit. For the online monitor system, the single photon emission computed tomography using prompt gamma-ray was studied to provide an ideal dose estimation system. A neutron producing target system with a liquid lithium jet flow of about 30Â m/s at a thickness of 1Â mm and a cross-sectional area of 50Â mmÂ ÃÂ 50Â mm is proposed. },

  Abstract                 = {Dating of late Holocene landforms below treeline in high mountains is commonly done using dendrochronology. Four factors can reduce the accuracy of ages obtained by dendrochronology: (1) locating the oldest living tree on a surface; (2) the method of counting the rings; (3) the age-height correction factor; and (4) ecesis, which is the time it takes trees to successfully germinate on a bare surface. A review of published studies from the western Cordillera of the Americas shows that some of these issues have not been fully addressed. Research in Garibaldi Provincial Park in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia shows that the accuracy of tree-ring ages can be improved if (1) crossdating and chronology construction, rather than simple ring counts, are done; (2) individual age-height correction factors are applied; and (3) site-specific ecesis estimates are made. While these suggestions are not always necessary to their fullest extent, researchers should at least report their methods in more detail and provide uncertainties in their age estimates that take into account age-height and ecesis corrections. },

  Abstract                 = {The average absorbed dose and dose equivalent rates from space radiation were observed using passive dosimeters with same material and configuration at the same location onboard the International Space Station (ISS) over four different occasions (IâIV) between 2007 and 2008. The passive dosimeters consisted of a combination of thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) and plastic nuclear track detectors (PNTDs). Total average absorbed dose rate increased by 68Â Â±Â 9% over two years. The observed increase was due to the incremental increase in the altitude of the \{ISS\} over the course of the experiment and the corresponding increase in trapped proton flux encountered during passage of the \{ISS\} through the \{SAA\} (South Atlantic Anomaly), which was confirmed with the results monitored by DB-8 active dosimeter on the ISS. The \{PNTD\} data showed that the average absorbed dose and dose equivalent rates from particles of LETâH2OÂ â¥Â 100Â keV/Î¼m were 28Â Â±Â 2% and 51Â Â±Â 3% of â¥10Â keV/Î¼m during Periods IâIII, while the dose contributions of particles â¥100Â keV/Î¼m during Period \{IV\} were 36Â Â±Â 5% and 59Â Â±Â 10%, respectively. The integral dose equivalent distribution during Period \{IV\} shows significant enhancement from particles â¥100Â keV/Î¼m. These facts suggest that a significant fraction of the high \{LET\} component is due to short-range recoil nuclei produced in target fragmentation reactions between primary protons and the nuclei of the passive dosimeters and surrounding materials. },

The response data obtained by \{AFM\} for â¼2Â Î¼m bulk etch was in good agreement with data obtained by the conventional optical microscope analysis for larger bulk etch. The response data from low energy beams (stopping near the surface) was also consistent with the data from high energy beams (penetrating the detector) as a function of \{REL\} (restricted energy loss) with the Î´-ray cut off energy of Ï0Â =Â 200Â eV. We experimentally verified that \{REL\} (Ï0Â =Â 200Â eV) gives a universal function for wide energy range in CR-39 PNTD.

The surface impact structures form hillocks with greater diameters but smaller heights for low-energetic ions and smaller diameters but greater heights for high-energetic ions. The observed hillock widths range from 22Â Â±Â 2Â nm for low-energetic ions to 17Â Â±Â 1Â nm for the highest energy in mica. Furthermore, the dimensions formed in apatite for low and high-energy ions range from 53Â Â±Â 2Â nm to 27Â Â±Â 2Â nm and from 64Â Â±Â 3Â nm to 28Â Â±Â 1Â nm in zircon. With increasing 129I particle energy hillock heights increase, but diameters decrease regardless of mineral orientation. The crystallographic orientation of apatite and zircon also seems to have no effect on hillock dimensions, which are identical for perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis oriented mineral grains. The results support the âCompound Spikeâ track formation model of Chadderton (2003), which combines the Coulomb ion explosion model with a thermal spike model. },

In particular there is a lack of the data for energy spectra in water. However, the spectra in water differ from those in air significantly because of strong photon scattering processes. The aim of this paper was the presentation of the wide range of detailed data for the 6Â MV X-ray therapeutic beams from a medical linear accelerator Clinac-2300 by Varian. The presented data were derived by the use of Monte Carlo computer simulations (GEANT4 code). The performed investigations indicate that shapes of the spectra, total number of photon registered in a bin as well as mean energy of the considered beam depend on a depth in water, on a distance from the central-axis of the beam and on a radiation field size. However, shapes of the spectra as well as the beam mean energy does not depend on a bin size, independently of a depth in water and a radiation field whereas total number of photon registered in a bin is related to a bin size. Majority of the presented results were obtained for a cylindrical 1.41Â cm3 bin with the radius of 1.5Â cm. The obtained data are very useful for the accurate absorbed depth-dose determination particularly outside the reference conditions, for advanced treatment planning systems, for constructors of medical accelerators etc. },

Plastic Optical Fibers (POFs) and Glass Optical Fibers (GOFs) are used as signal conduits for laboratory and clinical testing. Further, reduction of electron-beam-generated Cerenkov light in optical fibers is facilitated by the inclusion of metalized air-core capillary tubing between the BCF-12 plastic scintillating fiber and the POF. In a clinical setting dose linearity, percent depth dose, and angular measurements for 6Â MV/18Â MV photon beams and 9Â MeV electron beams are compared with and without the use of the air-core capillary tubing for BCF-12 plastic scintillating fiber.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and other retrospective dosimetry studies there is considerable demand for the ability to measure luminescence from individual dosimeters in the size range 50â500Â Î¼m diameter, either as separate grains or as part of a matrix. This work tests the potential of an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), providing extremely low level light detection. We characterize the performance of the device by discussing reproducibility and evaluating uncertainties in \{OSL\} signals. Finally we derive a typical single grain natural dose distribution with associated uncertainties. },

MCP-N \{TL\} detectors installed in the \{RADOS\} dosimetry badge were covered with non-uniform Pb and Cu filters. Quantitative identification of the static exposure cases was performed by analyzing the distribution of pixel intensity in the images obtained in the TL-CCD reader (Kopec etÂ al., 2010). We demonstrate the possibility of automatically distinguishing cases of static exposure for doses as low as 5Â mSv, up to mean X-ray energies of 250Â keV and for exposure angles up to 60Â°. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Within a systematic study of a novel system enabling 2D readout of \{TL\} foils, the X-ray energy and dose response was investigated in \{TL\} foils containing LiF:Mg,Cu,P (MCP-N) or CaSO4:Dy as activators. Foils were exposed to broad X-ray beams of mean energies ranging between 45Â keV and 208Â keV (ISO 4037 standard), with reference to 662Â keV 137Cs gamma rays. The MCP-N foils, of about 380Â nm emission wavelength, show a flat X-ray energy response, but low sensitivity. Due to poor \{TL\} light detection efficiency of the \{CCD\} (charge-coupled device) camera over this range of wavelengths, only doses exceeding 500Â mGy can be reliably measured. In the case of CaSO4:Dy foils, their \{TL\} light emitted around 450Â nm wavelengths is registered by the \{CCD\} camera with no loss of efficiency, enabling X-ray doses as low as 100Â mGy to be evaluated. Unlike that of MCP-N, the dose response of CaSO4:Dy foils is highly supralinear. Nevertheless, within experimental conditions applied in this study, the 2D-TL technique may be applied to determine Entrance Surface Dose or Maximum Skin Dose in radiology. The more sensitive CaSO4:Dy foils could be used only in a well-specified radiation field (e.g., in mammography) or in qualitative dose mapping. },

One conventional diagnostic scintigraphy department, where Tc-99m, I-131 and Sm-153 were applied, and two PET-CT departments where F-18 was applied in preparation and application procedures, were studied. A novel eye lens dosemeter was used, designed to evaluate Hp(3) directly. From our measurements we obtained ratios of Hp(3)/Hp(10) ranging between 0.7 and 1.1 indicating that in nuclear medicine procedures eye lens doses could probably be estimated from Hp(10) values and that exceeding the present annual dose limit to eye lens (150Â mSv) is very unlikely. The relationship between different individual doses can indicate the quality of radiation protection in a nuclear medicine department. },

  Abstract                 = {Measurements performed within the \{ORAMED\} project helped to evaluate the dose levels to the operatorsâ hands, wrists, legs and eye lenses, during several types of interventional radiology (IR) and cardiology (IC) procedures, and also to determine the parameters that affect the doses. However, the study of the effect of each parameter separately, was possible only through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, as in clinical practice many of those parameters change simultaneously. The influence of the protective equipment, the beam projections, the beam quality, the field size and the position of the operator according to the position of access of the catheter was investigated, using anthropomorphic phantoms in setups that represent realistic IR/IC procedures. The proper use of protective shields was found to be the most important way of reducing extremity and eye lens exposure during such examinations. Ceiling suspended shields can reduce the doses to the eye lenses up to 97%, but they can also reduce hand doses about 70% when placed correctly. The highest exposure to the operator is observed for left anterior oblique (LAO) and cranial projections. Additionally, for overcouch irradiations the eyes and the hands are about 6 times more exposed compared to the cases where the tube is below the operating table. For the lateral \{LAO\} projection, placing the ceiling suspended shield at the left side of the operator is twice more effective for the protection of the eyes compared to the cases where it is placed above the patient. Finally, beam collimation was found to play an important role in the reduction of the hands and wrists doses, especially when the operator is close to the irradiation field. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The pre-dosed thermoluminescence (TL) emission of quartz has been found to be useful in retrospective dosimetry and archaeometry. Though the pre-dosed optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and \{TL\} emissions have been reported to be similar, the former has been found to be un-reliable for the equivalent dose estimation. As this measurement protocol involves thermal heating at around 400Â Â°C, the work reported in this paper investigated the influence of this heating on the \{OSL\} using fired specimens from various regions. The results suggested that the discrepancy in the behaviour of two emissions is caused by the presence of the thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) induced by thermal-activation involved in the pre-dose treatment. This transferred signal was observed to be very significant in the case of samples containing a prominent higher-temperature \{TL\} peak at â¼375Â Â°C. The characterization of this signal based on (i) the nature of the glow curves, (ii) thermal-annealing of the \{OSL\} trap, (iii) observation of the TT-OSL, (iv) bleaching of the source trap and (v) the correlation between \{TL\} and \{OSL\} seems to suggest that the trap corresponding to this \{TL\} peak is the source trap in the TT-OSL emission mechanism. },

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents the results of intercalibration measurements of 222Rn concentration in water samples. The aim of the experiments was to evaluate the different measurement methods of radon determination in water samples performed by eleven laboratories in Poland and to test these methods in field work. In the years 2001â2003 three national intercomparison experiments were organized. The results allowed the participating laboratories to improve their measurement methodologies and to achieve better, i.e. more convergent results of determining radon concentration in water samples. The results show that the use of liquid-scintillation technique seems to be the best measurement method. It should be emphasized that comparative experiments are essential for all laboratories and they should be carried out as often as possible, based both on prepared samples with known concentration values of 222Rn and natural water samples, the most commonly used in laboratory practice. },

Such samples change colour from white to blue (NBT) or red (TTC) if exposed to ionizing radiation or \{UV\} light. When inhomogenously irradiated, a clear pattern of the absorbed dose distribution is visible to the naked eye. Performance of quantitative 2D analysis with the aid of a flat-bed document scanner was proposed. Most importantly, the application of a scanner is an easy method for the assessment of irradiated samples. Therefore, scanning parameters such as resolution, sharpness, scanning reproducibility and sample preparation were assessed in this work; and optimal parameters were chosen. The cause of uncertainty in the measurements is discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The development of flat woven fabric-based ionizing radiation 2D dosimeters is reported in this work. Polyamide fabric was surface modified with radiation-sensitive 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) or nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT). These samples responded to gamma radiation of 60Co through a colour change: red and blue for \{TTC\} and NBT, respectively. The tinge intensity was observed to depend on the absorbed dose, which allowed for the reflectance of light (R) measurements and calculation of the calibration parameters: dose range, quasi-linear range, threshold dose and sensitivity. Oxygen was shown to be an important factor determining the dose response of the samples. For this reason, a range of additional modifications to the TTC- and NBT-polyamide fabric was proposed which lead to a decrease in the threshold dose and increase in the sensitivity to irradiation of the samples. For instance, a dosimeter made of polyamide fabric modified with 10Â g/dm3 TTC, 0.5Â mol/dm3 tert-butyl alcohol, 7.5% gelatine hydrogel at pH 10 (vacuum packed) showed the lowest dose threshold (50Â Gy), dose range up to 2.8Â kGy and the highest sensitivity to irradiation (â0.0396%/Gy) among the compositions studied. In consequence, this dosimeter was examined in terms of response to inhomogeneous irradiation from a 192Ir brachytherapy radiation source. The relative dose distribution profiles across the source's longitudinal axis were calculated. This showed potential of the textile dosimeters for 2D dose distribution measurements; however, further modifications towards improvement of the dosimeter's low dose response can be considered. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports on the preparation and features of a \{UV\} light dosimeter composed of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) and polyamide woven fabric. This textile dosimeter is based on the conversion reaction of \{NBT\} into formazan, which was initially examined in aerated aqueous solutions through steady state \{UV\} irradiation. Irradiated solutions change their colour as a consequence of the formation of polydisperse \{NBT\} formazan particles. This was analysed in relation to the absorbed dose of \{UV\} light through UVâVIS spectrophotometry and dynamic laser light scattering measurements. When \{NBT\} substrate molecules are embedded in polyamide textile, \{UV\} irradiation leads to similar effects as in solution. However, the tinge intensity changes at much lower absorbed doses. The dependence of the tinge intensity on the absorbed dose was followed by measurements of the remission of light from the NBT-polyamide samples. Consequently, the calibration parameters were calculated such as the dose sensitivity, dose range, and quasi-linear dose range. An improvement of the NBT-polyamide samples by application of a colour levelling agent and improvement of their resistance to humidity is presented. Finally, the samples were used for estimation of absorbed \{UV\} energy distribution showing their capability as new dosimeters for in-plane high resolution radiation dose measurements. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, results on the construction of a new flat textile-based \{UV\} light dosimeter are reported. As a textile support polyamide woven fabric was chosen, which was surface-modified with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). At first, spectrophotometric and dynamic laser light scattering results on the steady-state \{UV\} irradiation of aqueous \{TTC\} solutions in the presence of oxygen are discussed. If irradiated, \{TTC\} converts to the corresponding formazan molecules of red colour. The size and size distribution of the particles is related to the absorbed radiation and pH of the solution. When \{TTC\} molecules reside on polyamide textile, \{UV\} irradiation causes a colour change from white to deep red. The tinge intensity depends on the absorbed energy per unit surface area. On this basis, the calibration parameters of the detectors, such as dose sensitivity, dose range, quasi-linear dose range, were calculated. Furthermore, the improvement of the dosimetersâ resistance to atmospheric conditions was achieved and assessed through washing fastness tests. Finally, the detectors were proved to be adequate for measurements of the 2D distribution of absorbed \{UV\} energy. A simple method of \{UV\} dose distribution measurements was proposed. The textile-based systems show promise as dosimeters. },

  Abstract                 = {An intensive measurement campaign was launched in different hospitals in Europe within work package 1 of the \{ORAMED\} project (Optimization of \{RAdiation\} protection for \{MEDical\} staff). Its main objective was to obtain a set of standardized data on extremity and eye lens doses for staff in interventional radiology (IR) and cardiology (IC) and to optimize staff protection. The monitored procedures were divided inÂ threeÂ main categories: cardiac, general angiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography(ERCP) procedures. Using a common measurement protocol, information such as the protective equipment used (lead table curtain, transparent lead glass ceiling screen, patient shielding, whole body shielding or special cabin etc.) as well as Kerma Area Product (KAP) values and access of the catheter were recorded. This study was performed with a final database of more than 1300 procedures performed in 34 European hospitals. Its objectives were firstly to determine if the measured extremity doses could be correlated to the \{KAP\} values; secondly to check if the doses to the eyes could be linked to the doses to the hands (finger or wrist positions) and finally if the doses to the fingers could be estimated based on the doses to the wrists. General correlations were very difficult to find and their strength was mostly influenced by three main parameters: the X-ray tube configuration, the room collective radioprotective equipment and the access of the catheter. The \{KAP\} value can provide a simple mean to estimate the extremity doses of the operator given that it is assessed correctly for the operator when he is actually using the X-ray tube. Moreover, this study showed that the doses to the left finger are strongly correlated to the doses to the left wrist when no ceiling shield is used. It is also possible to estimate the doses to the eyes given the doses to the left finger or left wrist but the X-ray tube configuration and the access have to be considered. The annual finger doses of three workers were estimated and were found to exceed the 3/10thof the annual limit. Therefore, for the hands routine monitoring is necessary especially for interventional cardiology procedures, except for \{ERCP\} procedures. If the table shield is properly used, leg doses can be reduced significantly and no routine monitoring is necessary. },

  Abstract                 = {Introduction Modern radiotherapy is characterised by increasingly complex radiation delivery such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (ESR). It has become common practice to verify the delivery for each patient in IMRT, however, no such methods have been defined to date for ESR. It was the aim of the present work to develop a method to verify the dose distribution for \{ESR\} in a moving phantom using radiochromic film. Methods Radiochromic film (ISP EBT2) was used in a cylindrical film cassette fitted into a \{QUASAR\} phantom (Modus Medical). The cassette can be moved forwards and backwards with motion patterns that can mimic the breathing of individual patients. The radiotherapy treatment plans of four patients were re-planned for the phantom. Between 8 and 10 radiation fields of 6Â MV photons from a Varian Trilogy linear accelerator were used to deliver target doses between 18 and 26Â Gy per fraction. In order to allow for measurements with \{EBT2\} film all monitor units were divided by 3 or 4 resulting in maximum doses not exceeding 10Â Gy. The film was evaluated using a transmission scan on an Epson Perfection \{V700\} scanner with 50Â dpi spatial resolution (3 colors, 48bit). A calibration curve was used to convert either the red or green component of the scan to dose. Results Qualitative film analysis found no discernible discrepancies from planned isodose distributions in the stationary images. The dose distribution in the moving phantom was used successfully to confirm the appropriateness of the \{ITV\} construction in the planning process. Conclusions We have developed a \{QA\} procedure that accounts for breathing patterns of individual patients in \{ESR\} for lung cancer. Radiochromic film was found to be easy to adapt to this process. },

  Abstract                 = {Î±-Al2O3 single crystals were irradiated to various thermal neutron fluences in the range of 1014 to 1018Â n/cm2 with associated fast neutron fluence and gamma rays in the \{CIRUS\} reactor. The neutron irradiation of Î±-Al2O3 crystals in the reactor introduces considerable oxygen vacancies in the crystals, which is confirmed by the presence of F (203Â nm) and F+ (225 and 255Â nm) bands in their optical absorption (OA) spectra. The concentration of the F and F+ centers increases with the increase in neutron fluence and are responsible for the observed \{TL\} and \{OSL\} in the Î±-Al2O3 single crystals. The F/F+ concentration ratio of Î±-Al2O3 samples irradiated to thermal neutron fluence of 1018Â n/cm2 (with an associated fast neutron fluence of 7Â ÃÂ 1015Â n/cm2) is 0.68. The photoluminescence and \{OA\} studies indicate formation of excess F+ center in the neutron irradiated Al2O3 single crystals. The \{TL\} glow curve of the reactor neutron irradiated Al2O3 is different from the \{TL\} glow curve structure of the TLD-500 single crystal. },

Measurements have been carried out using four different gamma sources with different energies ranging from 6Â keV to 1.332Â MeV and a Ni-63 beta source with a maximum energy of 66Â keV. Scintillator thicknesses ranged from 10Â Î¼m to 2500Â Î¼m. The response of the system was determined by measuring the integrated counts as a function of scintillator thickness. These experimental findings were used to empirically determine the optimum thickness of scintillator material with which to build a low energy beta detector which discriminates against high energy gamma photons in a mixed radiation field environment. },

The algorithm proposed and tested here pairs an exciting and relatively new model selection algorithm with the method of total least squares. Gamma-ray counts are modeled as Poisson processes where the average part is taken to be the model and the difference between the observed gamma-ray counts and the model is considered random noise. Physics provides a template for the model, but we add uncertainty to this template to simulate real life conditions. Unlike most model selection algorithms whose utilities are demonstrated asymptotically, our method emphasizes selection when data is fixed and finite (after all, detector data is undoubtedly finite). Simulation examples provided here demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs well. },

Since a shield will attenuate lower energies more so than higher ones, isotope sub-spectra must be introduced into models and into detection algorithms. We propose a new algorithm for detection, called group positive RIVAL, that encourages the selection of groups of sub-spectra rather than the selection of individual sub-spectra that may be from the same parent isotope. Indeed, the proposed algorithm incorporates group positive LASSO, and, as such, we supply the consistency results of group positive \{LASSO\} and adaptive group positive LASSO. In an example employing various shielding materials and material thicknesses, group positive \{RIVAL\} is shown to perform well in all scenarios with the exception of ones in which the shielding material is lead. },

  Abstract                 = {This work evaluated the neutron spectra induced by a medical used cyclotron. The neutrons were induced during the 18F-radioisotope productions due to the 9.6Â MeV proton beam hit 18O-water target and induced (p, n) reactions in this \{SK\} Cyclotron. To evaluate the induced neutron doses in the cyclotron room, dual-TLD chips and gold foils with bare and 113Cd covered were used separately to measure thermal neutron doses and fluence rates at positions outside the self-shielding of cyclotron, in the cases of using different targets. Besides, a 6LiI (Eu) detector with Bonner spheres were used and were placed at the specific locations in the cyclotron room to estimate the neutron spectra of using different operation parameters. In the results, the thermal neutron doses at the locations outside the self-shielding of cyclotron in the case of using target 1 were less than that using target 2. However, thermal neutron doses inside the self-shielding in the case of using target 1 were higher than that using target 2. The evaluated neutron spectra inside and outside the self-shielding confirmed the dose results. The impact of the volume of 18O-water target was discussed in this study. In conclusion, the large target volume (target 1) caused the higher production yield of 18F-radioisotope and induced lower dose and softer spectra of neutrons than the small target, under the same operation parameters which were adopted for validation in this study. },

The mechanism of in situ radon volatilization has been corroborated by the simultaneous concentration declines in groundwater-dissolved radon, methane, and ethane precursory to the 2011 \{MW\} 5.0 Chimei earthquake. The epicenter was located 32Â km from the Antung radon-monitoring well D1. Observations at the Antung hot spring also suggest that radon is the best-choice tracer among the groundwater-dissolved gases for strain changes in the crust preceding an earthquake.

Here, SrHfO3 has high melting point, and single crystal cannot be grown by micro pulling down method (which usually enables growth within less than 1 day) due to its high melting temperature. Since \{SPS\} can be used for preparation of the ceramics within roughly 10Â h at temperatures lower than the melting point, we use the \{SPS\} method for material preparation. Ce:SHO had a low transparency of less than 0.1% below 540-nm, while Ce/Al:SHO had a wider transparent region including the emission wavelength region of Ce3+ (â¼395Â nm). Ce/Al:SHO ceramics had light output of â¼4000 photons/MeV, and decay time of 21.6Â Â±Â 0.9Â ns. },

  Abstract                 = {Vacuum Ultra violet (VUV) scintillators, have a short decay time around several ns, and therefore can be used in high counting rate applications. New Nd-doped BaY2F8 \{VUV\} scintillator crystals were successfully grown by a micro-pulling down (Î¼-PD) method and their optical properties and radiation response were investigated. All the BaY2F8 samples with 0.5, 1, 3, 7 and 10Â mol% Nd concentration had 5d-4f luminescence peaks at 185, 237 and 270Â nm. Although this scintillator has low light output around 70Â photons/5.5-MeV alpha, which was determined from our pulse height measurement, we found that the decay time of this crystal reached 13Â ns which is a typical value for the \{VUV\} scintillators. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A prototype 3He-based Passive Neutron Albedo Reactivity (PNAR) counter was developed and tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in collaboration with the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to measure the fissile content in electrochemical recycling (ER) product materials. The counter consists of 16 3He cylindrical gas-filled proportional counters at 4Â atm of pressure embedded in high-density polyethylene. In this work, experimental measurements were performed at \{LANL\} to characterize the performance of the \{PNAR\} counter using surrogate materials for the uranium metal ingot. The purpose of these experiments was to: 1) measure the operating and calibration parameters of the \{PNAR\} counter (e.g. efficiency profiles, coincidence gate fractions, die-away time) and 2) evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of the \{PNAR\} method and the time correlated induced fission (TCIF) method for quantifying the 235U mass in \{PWR\} fresh \{LEU\} fuel rods and Materials Testing Reactor (MTR) \{HEU\} fuel plates. A small 244Cm reference source (13,373 n/s) was placed in the center of the fuel rods and fuel plates to simulate spontaneous fission from sub-ppm (parts per million) levels of Cm contamination in the U ingot. In order to compare the relative accuracy of the \{PNAR\} and \{TCIF\} methods for quantifying 235U mass, calibration curves were generated for the net doubles rate and the doubles Cd ratio using the Deming software. The results from this experiment will be used to obtain a better understanding of the sensitivity of the \{PNAR\} and \{TCIF\} methods for samples with low neutron multiplication. Furthermore, this experimental measurement data will also help inform safeguards research and development (R&amp;D) efforts on the viability of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques and detector designs for quantifying fissile content in \{ER\} product materials. Future work will include performing measurements with the \{PNAR\} counter on small samples of U/TRU materials. },

  Abstract                 = {Disequilibria in uranium series and their consequences on the annual dose determination in luminescence dating studies are now well-known, but only a few studies refer to the systematic research of this kind of phenomenon, and eventually to how the problem has been misguided. The present work aims at considering a new case study: anciently heated ferruginous sandstones from a Magdalenian archaeological site have been dated by thermoluminescence. In this work, uranium series disequilibrium has been detected both in samples and surrounding sediments, using high resolution low background gamma spectrometry measurements. Further investigations, in particular with alpha-spectrometry measurements and geochemical considerations, helped us to understand when and how the disequilibrium began, and it led us to propose a specific simple model, based on a continuous and regular enrichment in uranium, for the evaluation of the mean annual dose absorbed by the samples to be dated. This work deals with the results of gamma and alpha-spectrometry as well as the dose variation model proposed and the dating results obtained, in terms of annual dose determination and in terms of age obtained. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Organ-based tube-current modulation (OB-TCM) is a new technique of radiation dose reduction to reduce superficial doses to eyes, thyroid, and breast. Several studies have investigated the dose reduction with OB-TCM. However, the superficial doses in case when bodies are located at off-centre positions, have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of shifting the patient's body off-centre on the reduction of dose to anterior surfaces of eyes and breast with OB-TCM. A 16-cm \{CT\} dose index phantom and a semi-anthropomorphic acrylic thorax phantom were used to represent a normal-sized adult. The effect of in-plane eye and breast shields in addition to OB-TCM on the radiation output was also studied in off-centre phantom locations using a \{CT\} ionization chamber. The superficial doses of phantoms at off-centre position of 50, 25,Â â25,Â â50, andÂ â75Â mm were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeter chips, and compared with superficial doses of phantoms located at the isocentre. The dose reduction trend is similar in the head and thoracic scanning regions, i.e. bismuth shielding alone offers less reduction than OB-TCM alone, and OB-TCM combined with bismuth shielding gives the best reduction. OB-TCM reduced by 26â28% of the anterior surface dose to the eyes, and increased by 25% the posterior surface dose. The free-in-air dose decreased as the chamber was placed away from the isocentre. OB-TCM could reduce by 22% the dose to the eyes, but gave the same dose to breast as automatic tube-current modulation. In phantoms placed at off-centre positions, OB-TCM increased by some 18% the dose to the eyes and doubled superficial dose to the breast in phantoms shifted downwards. },

Routine \{CT\} examinations of head, chest and abdomen were performed on a 10-year pediatric anthropomorphic phantom, with and without bismuth shield. A solid-state dosimeter was used to obtain real-time dose measurements and to estimate the dose reduction. The maximum dose reduction of eyes using bismuth shield for in-plane \{CT\} scanning can achieve 56% during spiral head scanning interval. The average dose reduction is around 25% for in-plane \{CT\} scanning, and reaches 62% combining the technique of automatic tube current modulation. The solid-state probe can provide fast and convenient measurements for dose estimation of superficial organs.

In our single grain experiments, the mean fading corrected \{IRSL\} age obtained from a small population of bright grains is close to the expected depositional age of the sediment investigated. It is proposed that in dating programs, more attention should be given to bright feldspar grains as they are the most stable grains in the population. },

  Abstract                 = {The performance of a synthetic diamond X-ray detector during typical clinical beam characterisation procedures was compared to the performance of standard clinical detectors; this diamond detector used a single crystal diamond film synthesised using chemical vapour deposition as its sensitive element. Measurements were performed using 6Â MV photons from a Varian 600C linear accelerator. The procedures measured the dose profile with depth along the central axis in a phantom (tissue maximum ratio) for a 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 field, variation in dose at the isocentre with field size (output factor), and dose profile across and beyond the X-ray beam (off-axis ratio) for 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 and 1Â ÃÂ 1Â cm2 fields. Tissue maximum ratio values were within 0.8% of the values from a standard ion chamber, over a depth range of 1â15Â cm. Output factors were measured for field sizes from 0.6Â ÃÂ 0.6Â cm2 to 15Â ÃÂ 15Â cm2 and agreed well (&lt;1.3% difference) with available ion chamber data for field sizes down to 3Â ÃÂ 3Â cm2. Off-axis measurements showed reduced penumbral width when the lateral size of the detector was reduced by holding the diamond detector in an edge-on orientation; values were comparable to those obtained using a diode detector. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of synthetic diamond detectors for clinical beam characterisation, particularly for small beam sizes. },

We first describe improvements to the existing \{RL\} option to allow near infra-red detection (NIR) during irradiation by the built-in 90Sr/90Y beta source. The \{RL\} optical signal is collected by a liquid light guide through an F34-901 interference filter and detection is based on a dedicated thermoelectrically cooled \{NIR\} sensitive \{PMT\} (detection window peak at 855Â nm, \{FWHM\} 27Â nm). Software and electronics have been modified to allow standard \{TL\} and \{OSL\} measurements in the same sequence as \{RL\} measurements. Together with a new bleaching source based on a high-power \{UV\} \{LED\} (395Â nm; 700Â mW/cm2), this facility has been used to measure natural doses in feldspar using the decaying \{NIR\} \{RL\} signal. Secondly, we present a method for mapping radiation field of the built-in 90Sr/90Y Î²-source and estimating grain-location specific dose-rates. This is important for the accuracy of single grain results, when radiation field is spatially non-uniform across the sample area. We document the effect of this correction method and further investigate on the effect of lifting the source to achieve a better dose-rate uniformity. Finally we summarise two recently-developed novel facilities to help investigate (i) the time scales involved in \{OSL\} processes (time-resolved exo-electron detection) and (ii) extending the age range (violet stimulated signals from deep quartz \{OSL\} traps). },

  Abstract                 = {Yellow stimulated luminescence (Y-OSL) is the light detected from potassium-rich feldspars at 410Â nm under stimulation by a yellow light source emitting 590Â nm. The investigation of this study aimed at understanding basic luminescence physics of Y-OSL in order to assess the suitability of the technique for dating. The Y-OSL signal properties tested were signal intensity, thermal assistance, thermal stability, sensitivity to daylight and the suitability of a single aliquot regenerative (SAR) protocol to be employed for equivalent dose (De) estimation. De measurements were conducted on samples of Holocene, last glacial and Tertiary age. The tests were undertaken on sedimentary feldspar separates extracted from aeolian, fluvial and coastal deposits. Results from experiments show that the signal intensity increases by measuring Y-OSL at elevated temperature suggesting thermal assistance characteristics similar to infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL). The yellow stimulated signal remains unaffected by preheat temperatures up to â¼200Â Â°C suggesting higher thermal stability than the \{IRSL\} signal. The Y-OSL signal is less light sensitive than the \{IRSL\} signal and De residuals obtained from modern samples are up to 7Â Gy indicating suitability of the technique for âolderâ and well-bleached sediments. The dose recovery tests successfully recovered the given dose if the specific light sensitivity of Y-OSL is taken into account. For every sample Y-OSL De values obtained by a single aliquot regenerative dose protocol (SAR) are higher than those obtained by an \{IRSL\} \{SAR\} approach. From these results we infer high thermal stability and a minimal anomalous fading of the Y-OSL signal. We conclude that Y-OSL has a high potential to date Quaternary sediments that were sufficiently bleached in nature. },

  Abstract                 = {Southern California comprises of a wide range of diverse landscapes and environments, from high mountains with glacial and periglacial sediments to deserts with large sand dunes, extensive alluvial fans and ephemeral playas. Highly active tectonic processes has exposed ancient (c. 2Â Ga) plutonic and metamorphic basement from deep within the crust, while similar Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks are also common. A rich array of volcanic lithologies extending into the late Quaternary complement many thick sedimentary sequences that formed in equally diverse ancient environments typical of an accreting active continental margin. In some locations, notably in the Coachella Valley close to Palm Springs and the Salton Sea, low \{OSL\} sensitivity and poor characteristics restrict the application of the quartz \{SAR\} protocol to date late Pleistocene and Holocene fluvial sediments. In other locations such as the Malibu coastline, high sensitivity of the quartz \{OSL\} signal is observed, despite local source rocks being dominated by volcanic lithologies. Problems of poor quartz characteristics, along with uncertainty in predicting quartz \{OSL\} behavior for future dating campaigns poses a significant problem for projects, in particular for neotectonic contexts. While K-feldspar has been used extensively to date eolian and fluvial sediments in southern California, little information regarding signal stability is available. We explore the characteristics of both quartz and feldspar sub-samples from eolian, fluvial, lacustrine environments, in order to help develop mineral selection criteria for optical dating applications and clarify these issues. The importance of radiation quenching in quartz grains recently eroded from bedrock and the role of fires in enhancing \{OSL\} sensitivity are considered. The relative bleachability of quartz and feldspar fractions, along with thermal stability considerations is discussed. A simple test for quartz \{OSL\} signal contamination based on thermal quenching and assistance, and the susceptibility of the \{OSL\} signal to \{IR\} bleaching is introduced. },

This study proposes to use the \{BEAM\} Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to assess characteristics of small electron beams (4, 6, 14, 30Â mm in diameter) with the kinetic energies of 6 and 18Â MeV. Three factors influencing beam characteristics were studied (1) \{AE\} and \{ECUT\} settings, (2) photon jaw settings and (3) simulation pixel sizes. Study results reveal that AE/ECUT settings at 0.7Â MeV are adequate for linear accelerator treatment head simulation, while 0.521Â MeV is more favorable to be used for the phantom study. It is also demonstrated that voxel size setting at 1/4 of the simulation field width in all directions is sufficient to achieve accurate results. As for the photon jaw setting, it has great impact on the absolute output of different field size setting (i.e. output factor) but with minimum effect on the relative lateral distribution. },

Change in Mg concentration did not affect significantly the ratio of \{TL\} responses of high and main dosimetric glow peaks. With Mg concentration in the range from 0.35 to 0.45Â mol% and a thermal treatment of 10Â min in the range from 400Â Â°C to 440Â Â°C followed by the thermal treatment at 260Â Â°C for 10Â min (dual-step thermal treatment) resulted in the highest value of the ratio of \{TL\} response of high and main dosimetric glow peaks. },

For blue (470Â nm) optical stimulation, RLÂ +Â OSL signal in LiAlO2 exhibited a sharp initial increase followed by a decay within the first 20Â s of continuous wave (CW)-OSL and a very slow increase thereafter. The RLÂ +Â OSL signal was about 1.25 times of its \{RL\} signal in LiAlO2 as compared to 2.5 times in Al2O3:C. With the continued beta irradiation, the \{RL\} signal exhibited a faster growth in LiAlO2 than that in Al2O3:C. Emission spectrum of LiAlO2 exhibited multiple emission peaks in the range from 320 to 380Â nm as against 410Â nm of Al2O3:C. \{RL\} and \{OSL\} emission spectra were similar in both LiAlO2 and Al2O3:C. The intense \{RL\} in LiAlO2 (about 300 times of that of its background signal) for a beta ray dose rate of 4.6Â mGy/s appears attractive for radiation dosimetry including real time/online dosimetry and dose mapping. },

The aims of this study were to make \{RPLGD\} by ourselves (hereafter, homemade RPLGP) and investigate radiation characteristics of homemade RPLGD. Several chemical compounds (AlPO4, AgCl, AgNO3, B2O3, H3PO4, Na3PO4, and P2O5), high temperature oven, Pantak X-ray \{HF\} 420, 60Co radiation source, and FGD-1000 readout system were used. Based on this study, we found that the homemade \{RPLGD\} has wider radiation detection range, slight angular dependence, and good dose linearity. The development and clinical applications of our \{RPLGD\} will be continuously improved in our laboratory. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractIntroduction EPR-dosimetry using l-Î±-alanine is an established method for measuring high doses of ionizing radiation. However, since a minimum dose of approximately 4Â Gy is required to achieve sufficient low uncertainties (1â2%) for clinical application, alternative dosimeter materials are being inquired. Lithium formate (LiFo) monohydrate has been studied by several groups and has revealed several promising properties in the low dose region (&lt;4Â Gy). The fading properties, however, are somewhat unpredictable, and depend on properties not yet fully uncovered. This paper reports the results from a study of lithium formate hydrate and N-methyl taurine as potential low dose \{EPR\} dosimeters. Methods and materials Pellet shaped dosimeters of lithium formate monohydrate, lithium formate hydrate, sodium dithionate and N-methyl taurine were produced using a manual Weber press, l-Î±-alanine was obtained from Harwell dosimeters and irradiated using 60Â kV and 6Â MV X-ray beams, and Co-60 gamma-rays to a dose of 30Â Gy and dose ranges of 0.5â100Â Gy and 2â20Â Gy respectively. The dosimeters were measured using an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)-spectrometer. The detector responses for 6Â MV and Co-60 radiation beams, the fading behaviors and signal shape in time were investigated. Results Lithium formate monohydrate and lithium formate hydrate are apparently associated with near identical EPR-spectra (mainly one broad line), and the same spectrum arises for all radiation energies investigated. The shape of the \{EPR\} resonance remains constant with time, but the intensities decreases, and the fading is more prominent for the monohydrate than for the hydrate. The \{EPR\} resonance associated with N-methyl taurine is more complex than the resonance associated with LiFo and it changes with time, implying radical transitions and growth. Conclusions The study showed that lithium formate hydrate is a strong candidate for \{EPR\} dosimetry with slightly better fading characteristics compared to lithium formate monohydrate. },

  Abstract                 = {Intensive synchrotron X-ray microbeams form an integral part of microbeam radiation therapy (MRT). \{MRT\} is a novel radiation medicine modality being developed for inoperable and otherwise untreatable brain tumours. The extremely high dose rate (â¼20Â kGy/s), laterally fractionated radiation field and steep dose gradients utilized in this therapy make real-time dosimetry a significant challenge. In order for this treatment to advance to the clinical trial stage of development real-time dosimetry systems must be developed. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of a new dosimetry system based on an epitaxial silicon detector. The system combines high spatial resolution and real-time readout and we have measured the lateral dose profile of the \{MRT\} radiation field which incorporates 59 X-ray microbeams. All microbeam peaks and valley regions between two microbeams are clearly resolved. The measured detector response at any point is reproducible to within 0.5% after scaling for the known synchrotron storage ring beam current lifetime. The variation of the lateral dose profile at different depths in a \{PMMA\} phantom has been measured with the results compared to those from Penelope Monte Carlo simulations. The trend in the measured response with depth agrees with the simulation data (within the experimental variation of the central five microbeams peaks and valleys measured). However the measured peak-to-valley ratio response is a factor of 4.5Â Â±Â 0.1 times lower than that expected. The disagreement was further investigated and shown to be contributed to by charge recombination effects at the low bias voltages used. },

A dependence of thermal stability of \{IRSL\} signal on \{IR\} stimulation time and stimulation temperature were observed in pulse annealing studies. Relatively lower thermal stability is given by the initial part of the \{IRSL\} measured at 50Â Â°C, than the later part of \{IRSL\} curve. Based on these observations, the thermal stability of the post-IR \{IRSL\} signal stimulated at elevated temperatures (100â200Â Â°C) was also investigated. It was found that at least two groups of traps (shallow and deep) are associated with the \{IRSL\} and post-IR \{IRSL\} signals. The \{IRSL\} signal obtained at 50Â Â°C is mainly from the shallow traps while the post-IR \{IRSL\} obtained at elevated temperatures is mainly from the deep traps. The kinetics parameters obtained using pulse annealing test indicate that the shallow \{IRSL\} traps are probably associated with the â¼300â350Â Â°CÂ TL peak and the deep traps are probably associated with the â¼400Â Â°CÂ TL peak. The shallow traps (â¼350Â Â°CÂ TL peak) are associated with those easy-to-fade traps and the deep traps (â¼400Â Â°CÂ TL peak) are associated with hard-to-fade traps. },

Meanwhile, it's found that the radiation induced color centers are respectively peaked at the wavelength of 448Â nm, 512Â nm and 590Â nm. Those color centers should be ascribed to the Vk, \{VF\} and F center respectively. },

Two scanner modes were used; axial mode and helical mode, and the effect of varying beam collimation and pitch was studied. With an increase in beam collimation in axial mode and an increase of \{CT\} pitch in helical mode, cumulative point dose at scanner isocentre decreased while \{FWHM\} increased. There was generally good agreement to within 3% between the acquired dose profiles obtained by the \{DMG\} and the film except at dose profile tails, where film over-responded by up to 30% due to its intrinsic depth dose dependence at low doses. },

MOSkinâ¢ dosimeters were placed within the phantom to measure absorbed point organ doses for 2 commonly applied clinical scan protocols, namely the renal calculus scan and the pulmonary embolus scan. Measured organ doses in the imaged field of view were found to be in the dose range 4.7â9.5Â mGy and 16.2â27.4Â mGy for the renal calculus scan and pulmonary scan protocols respectively. For the derivation of effective dose, using the more recent \{ICRP\} 103 tissue weighting factors (wT) compared to that of the \{ICRP\} 60 wT resulted in a difference in the derived effective dose by up to 0.8Â mSv (â20%) in the renal calculus protocol and up to 1.8Â mSv (18%) in the pulmonary embolus protocol. This difference is attributed to the reduced radiosensitivity of the gonads and the increased radiosensitivity of breast tissue in the latest \{ICRP\} 103 assigned wT. The results of this study show that the MOSkinâ¢ dosimeter is a useful real-time tool for the direct assessment of organ doses in clinical \{MSCT\} examinations. },

Our results indicate that the yellow luminescence (YL) remains disappear after all annealing treatments and shows a non-linear dependence on the annealing temperature up to 800Â Â°C. The annealing process can be divided into two main stages associated with irradiation defects. At annealing temperatures up to 600Â Â°C, the behavior of \{YL\} can be attributed to the net effects of \{VGaON\} complex formation caused by the migration of gallium vacancies (VGa) and \{VGaON\} complex dissociation due to the disappearance of gallium vacancies. At annealing temperatures approaching 800Â Â°C, the incorporation of carbon into the group-V sublattice becomes the dominant factor in the appearance of YL. In addition, experimental results of \{PL\} and \{SEM\} show that a small proportion of irradiation damage still exists in GaN after annealing at 800Â Â°C. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The x-y plane combined with z-axis automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique is one of the most comprehensive approaches to \{CT\} dose reduction because the radiation dose is adjusted according to patient attenuation in three dimensions. The 320-detector row \{CT\} scanner has the widest scan range (16Â cm) within one axial rotation and equips with volume scan \{ATCM\} (VS-ATCM) mode. Special attention is needed while utilizing VS-ATCM mode in \{CT\} acquisitions especially scanning different anatomical regions, such as neck and shoulder in a single volume. However, the mechanism of VS-ATCM of the 320-detector row \{CT\} scanner remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the performance of VS-ATCM mode in a 320-detector row \{CT\} scanner. A phantom set consists of three simple-shaped phantoms was scanned with the VS-ATCM mode. A solid-state detector was inserted into the central position of the phantom set to measure the real-time dose profiles at seven positions within five scan volumes. The effective tube-current time product of each slice was recorded. The standard deviation of the \{CT\} numbers measured at each image slice was used as a noise measurement. The performance of helical scan \{ATCM\} (HS-ATCM) mode was in comparison of VS-ATCM mode. The results indicated that VS-ATCM mode can provide a less dose \{CT\} scanning to a patient but resulted in a higher image noise in comparison with those of HS-ATCM mode. In clinical practice, radiologists or radiological technologists should pay more attention on the volume position when using VS-ATCM mode for patient imaging. Our experience can be a reference to others for implementation of clinical practices. },

  Abstract                 = {Aqueous characteristics and activity concentrations of U/Th-series radionuclides were investigated in the birthplace of hokutolite â the Peito Hot Spring Area in Taiwan. Water samples were taken in 12 locations from the hot spring pond and the Peito Creek in this study. Temperature, acidity and redox potential exhibited similar trends decreasing from the hot spring pond toward downstream Peito Creek. The aqueous environment of this area existed in an acidic and oxidative state and was found influenced by hot spring water drawing and wastewater discharge. Major ions in water were Fe3+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Pb2+, Clâ and SO42â, which (except for Ba2+) generally varied with sampling locations in a tendency similar to those of temperature, acidity and redox potential. U/Th-series radionuclides were examined by Î± spectrometry while 226Ra were determined with ICP-QMS. Th-series was found predominant over U-series in this area. Activity concentrations of 238U (0.09 Â± 0.02 to 2.69 Â± 0.13 pCi/L) and 234U (0.10 Â± 0.02 to 2.64 Â± 0.13 pCi/L) were similar and the activity ratios for 234U/238U were greater than unity. For 230Th and 226Ra, the activity concentrations were respectively 0.07 Â± 0.03 to 0.86 Â± 0.06 pCi/L and 0.17 Â± 0.02 to 1.49 Â± 0.06 pCi/L, which led to activity ratios of 230Th/234U lower than unity while those of most 226Ra/230Th greater than unity. In Th-series, the activity concentrations of 232Th (0.06 Â± 0.02 to 0.90 Â± 0.06 pCi/L) and 230Th were similar at the sampling area. Apparent disequilibria were discovered between 228Ra and 232Th resulting from abundant 228Ra (6.01 Â± 0.41 to 10.5 Â± 0.8 pCi/L). The variation for activity concentration of 228Th (0.43 Â± 0.06 to 9.26 Â± 0.18 pCi/L) with sampling locations was similar to that of 232Th. However, significant disequilibria were discovered between 228Th and 232Th. The reported data contribute to the assessment of radionuclides distribution and the investigation of hokutolite recovery in the studied area. },

In a previous study, \{HVL\} measurements using \{TLDs\} exhibited extremely poor accuracies, about 50% uncertainty. A compact device that accommodated 15 \{TLD\} chips and 4 different thicknesses of aluminum sheets in a small holder was designed to determine \{HVLs\} for mammographic exposure conditions. The scatter and energy dependence correction factors must be taken into account when using this device. In this study, the scatter correction factor was separated into two components: scatter from an acrylic holder and scatter from covering aluminum sheets. The absolute energy dependence correction factor of \{TLDs\} was also evaluated. Scatter from the acrylic holder ranged from 2.5% to 2.9% and was independent of column positions. The influence of scatter and energy dependence increased with aluminum sheet thickness due to beam qualities. The designed \{TLD\} accommodation device was useful for determining \{HVLs\} in a single exposure when the scatter correction factors for the device and energy dependence correction factors for \{TLDs\} were taken into consideration. },

  Abstract                 = {It is often useful to get a quick estimate of the dose or dose equivalent of an organ, such as blood-forming organs, the eye or the skin, in a radiation field. Sometimes an equivalent sphere is used to represent the organ for this purpose. For space radiation environments, recently it has been shown that the equivalent sphere model does not work for the eye or the skin in solar particle event environments. In this study, we improve the representation of the eye and the skin using a two-component equivalent sphere model. Motivated by the two-peak structure of the body organ shielding distribution for the eye and the skin, we use an equivalent sphere with two radius parameters, for example a partial spherical shell of a smaller thickness over a proper fraction of the full solid angle combined with a concentric partial spherical shell of a larger thickness over the rest of the full solid angle, to represent the eye or the skin. We find that using an equivalent sphere with two radius parameters instead of one drastically improves the accuracy of the estimates of dose and dose equivalent in space radiation environments. For example, in solar particle event environments the average error in the estimate of the skin dose equivalent using an equivalent sphere with two radius parameters is about 8%, while the average error of the conventional equivalent sphere model using one radius parameter is around 100%. },

  Abstract                 = {\{ESR\} dating of fluvial terraces is usually based on the assumption of sunlight resetting of the Al centres in quartz. Very long bleaching times (months of sunlight exposure) are required to reset this centre to a stable, non-zero \{ESR\} intensity. Considering that highly light sensitive optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) analyses of fluvial samples often indicate partial bleaching, \{ESR\} dating should be extremely difficult. Two samples were analysed, a fluvial sediment from a Chinese river terrace and an Australian granite. Using a HÃ¶hnle sunlight simulator, the Ti centres of both samples were completely bleached within 1 to 65Â h, while the Al centre required extreme bleaching times to reach stable residual intensities (â¼1000Â h). As an alternative to light resetting, tumbler experiments were carried out to simulate fluvial action. The samples were treated under \{OSL\} sample preparation conditions. After relatively short tumbling times, corresponding to a few km of fluvial transport, both Al- and Ti-centres were partially reset. In a granite sample, the tumbling reduced the intensity of the Al centre more effectively than light exposure. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Although the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) based pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, realized by transforming the digitized scintillation pulses into frequency coefficients by using DFT, has been proven to effectively discriminate neutrons and Î³ rays, its discrimination performance depends strongly on the selection of the discrimination parameter obtained by the combination of these frequency coefficients. In order to thoroughly understand and apply the DFT-based \{PSD\} in organic scintillation detectors, a comparison of three different discrimination parameters, i.e. the amplitude of zero-frequency component, the amplitude difference between the amplitude of zero-frequency component and the amplitude of base-frequency component, and the ratio of the amplitude of base-frequency component to the amplitude of zero-frequency component, is described in this paper. An experimental setup consisting of an AmericiumâBeryllium (AmâBe) source, a \{BC501A\} liquid scintillator detector, and a 5Gsample/s 8-bit oscilloscope was built to assess the performance of the DFT-based \{PSD\} with each of these discrimination parameters in terms of the figure-of-merit (based on the separation of the event distributions). The third technique, which uses the ratio of the amplitude of base-frequency component to the amplitude of zero-frequency component as the discrimination parameter, is observed to provide the best discrimination performance in this research. },

  Abstract                 = {Nuclear terrorism has emerged as a significant threat which could require timely medical interventions to reduce potential radiation casualties. Early dose assessments are critical since optimal care depends on knowing a victimâs radiation dose. The dicentric chromosome aberration assay is considered the âgold standardâ to estimate the radiation dose because the yield of dicentrics correlates positively with the absorbed dose. Dicentrics have a low background frequency, are independent of age and gender and are relatively easy to identify. This diagnostic test for radiation exposure, however, is labor intensive and any single or small group of laboratories could easily be overwhelmed by a mass casualty event. One solution to this potential problem is to link the global \{WHO\} BioDoseNet members via the Internet so multiple laboratories could work cooperatively to screen specimens for dicentric chromosomes and generate timely dose estimates. Inter-laboratory comparison studies have shown that analysis of electronic chromosome images viewed on the computer monitor produces scoring accuracy equivalent to viewing live images in the microscope. This functional equivalence was demonstrated during a comparative study involving five laboratories constructing 60Co gamma ray calibration curves and was further confirmed when comparing results of blind dose estimates submitted by each laboratory. It has been further validated in two recent \{WHO\} BioDoseNet trial exercises where 20 metaphase images were shared by e-mail and 50 images were shared on a test website created for this purpose. The Internet-based exercise demonstrated a high level of concordance among 20 expert scorers who evaluated the same 50 metaphase spreads selected to exhibit no, low, moderate and severe radiation damage. Nineteen of 20 scorers produced dicentric equivalent counts within the 95% confidence limits of the mean. The Chi-squared test showed strong evidence of homogeneity in the data (pÂ =Â 0.999). Altogether, data obtained from these studies support the conclusion that Internet-based scoring is likely to overcome the âbottleneckâ in workflow, reduce turn-a-round time for dose estimates and ultimately strengthen surge capacity. Use of the Internet for biodosimetry would obviously leverage the human and equipment resources throughout the world. As part of radiation emergency planning, we conclude that a global \{IT\} network/infrastructure is needed to serve the needs of an expanding biodosimetry community and should be given high priority to meet the growing threat of radiological and nuclear terrorism. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This contribution presents a variety of different luminescence emission spectra from sedimentary feldspar and quartz samples under various stimulation modes. These are green stimulated quartz (OSL-) spectra, quartz \{TL\} spectra, feldspar \{IRSL\} and post-IR \{IRSL\} spectra. A focus was set at recording \{OSL\} and \{IRSL\} spectra at elevated stimulation temperatures such as routinely applied in luminescence dating. This was to test whether optical stimulation at elevated temperatures results in a shift of emission peaks. For \{OSL\} emissions of quartz, this has so far not been tested. In case of feldspar emissions, post-IR \{IRSL\} conditions, hence \{IRSL\} emissions at a low temperature, directly followed by high temperature post-IRSL emissions, are explicitly investigated. All spectra were recorded using a new system incorporated into a Lexsyg luminescence reader. Thus, this study, besides presenting new spectral data, also serves as a feasibility study for this new device. It is shown that (a) the new device is capable of automatically measuring different sorts of spectra, also at elevated temperatures, (b) known thermally and optically stimulated peak emissions of quartz and feldspar are confirmed, (c) obtained \{IRSL\} and \{OSL\} spectra indicate that there is no significant relation between peak emission and stimulation temperature. },

  Abstract                 = {A novel and evolutionary multiplexing technique is introduced in this work where electronic grade single crystal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond plates are multiplexed together in both a series and parallel configuration, sending electronic signals from each diamond plate to a single electronic acquisition system. Modeling of this novel multiplexing technique consisted of \{MCNPX\} simulations and significant post processing. The model developed allowed for the characterization of charge collection efficiency corrections to the location of charge creation to determine the effect of increasing detection medium size with respect to charge collection direction on the measured pulse height spectrum. This work was conducted to show that this technique is theoretically capable of replacing a single crystal diamond plate of similar size for use in neutron detection without the immediate need of advancing \{CVD\} diamond growth technologies. Further, this work indicates the expected pulse height evolution from a singular large single crystal diamond if such a crystal is produced in the future. The results of this work indicate that a 14.1Â MeV neutron induced energy pulse of 8.4Â MeV (due to the 12C(n,Î±o)9Be reaction) in the pulse height spectrum has its energy resolution broadened by a factor of two to a total value of 0.225 percent for a multiplexed array with a thickness from 0.05 to 1Â cm and an intrinsic detection efficiency of 25.4 percent for a 1Â cm thick diamond crystal. It is also qualitatively discussed that the number of secondary neutron interactions with the diamond detector array may be about 5 percent. The results of this work indicate the capability of multiplexing diamond plates together for spectroscopic neutron detection with a combined intrinsic detection efficiency and energy resolution greater than any other diamond-based neutron detection system reported to date. },

  Abstract                 = {Background and objective Respiratory-gated techniques are based on controlling the linear accelerator and limiting the beam-on time to only a small portion of the patientâs breathing cycle. For each beam-on, the machine must spend a start-up time (ST) to set up a stable and correct \{RF\} field in the waveguide and get the right beam current, etc. That might cause an obvious variation on the beam dosimetric characteristic, including the beam quality and profile, when the duration of \{ST\} is un-ignorable to the beam-on time. The purpose of this study is to investigate this kind of impact for various duty cycles (DC) of breathing-gated operation. Materials and method A respiratory motion phantom and a Real-time Position Management System (RPM) were used to simulate the patient respiration and to control the beam gating. Measurements were performed on a Varian 600C/D linac with 6Â MV photons, using different \{DCs\} of 5%, 7%, 10%, 12%, 20%, 50%, 75%, and 100% to a 6-s breathing cycle (BC) simulation. The beam quality, flatness, symmetry were evaluated for these conditions. Output reproducibility and dose linearity were measured and evaluated for different \{MUs\} at 400Â MU/min dose rate and 30% \{DC\} as well. Results For gated delivery in the above selected \{DCs\} and BC, the maximum changes in beam quality, symmetry, flatness wereÂ â0.181%, 0.124%,Â â0.17%, compared with non-gated data respectively. The coefficient of dispersion of output was less than 0.3% and good dose linearity was obtained for the tested gating operation condition. Conclusion For situation similar to our experiment, the duty cycle effect to beam characteristics is ignorable that the beam modeling based on non-gated delivery can be directly used for respiratory gating therapy. Otherwise, the beam characteristics should be carefully checked individually. },

This dosimeter is improved from the earlier version (2008) for personnel beta monitoring while still having full range photon performance. The dosimeter style, referred to as DXTRAD, is small in size and has identification by means of a circular barcode. It consists of a detector composed of a thin 7Â mgÂ cmâ2 monolayer of HarshawTLD-700H (7LiF:Mg,Cu,P) powder and a ring cap with a 3.3Â mgÂ cmâ2 entrance window. The use of the TLD-700H \{TLD\} material provides a good beta energy response as well as a flat energy response from low energy x-rays to high energy gamma rays. A new assembly tool that improves the consistency of dosimeter geometry and ruggedness for warm and cold sterilization is also developed. With the optimized design, this dosimeter is capable of meeting the stringent energy and angular response requirements of the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) for both betas and photons.

The sensor has been mounted on a photomultiplier tube controlled with a miniature electronics board and irradiated in different gamma and neutron radiation fields. A series of experiments has been carried out with different gamma energies as well as well with mono-energetic neutrons from a \{KN\} Van de Graaff accelerator, and the pulse height spectra have been measured. To clarify different features observed on the response functions of the detector, a Monte Carlo model of the scintillator has been built using \{MCNP6\} and emitted charged particles have been tracked. The simulation data along with the experiments are analyzed, compared and reported. },

This paper presents a novel dosimetry system based in a commercial phototransistor evaluated for \{CT\} dosimetry. Three detector configurations were developed for this system: with a single, two and four devices. Dose profile measurements were obtained with them and their angular responses were evaluated. The results showed that the novel dosimetry system with the phototransistor could be an alternative for \{CT\} dosimetry. It allows to obtain the \{CT\} dose profile in details and also to estimate the \{CTDI\} in longer length than the 100 mm pencil chamber. The angular response showed that the one device detector configuration is the most adequate among the three configurations analyzed in this study. },

The sediment infilling the egg provided material for luminescence dating that minimized problems of association. Age estimations from AAR, 14C and U series methods were obtained from the eggshell and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of the infilling sediment. All methods agreed within their respective dating uncertainties confirming the utility of all four methods. They indicate an age for the emu egg of 31.24 Â± 0.34 ka. },

The intensities of the luminescence from the 3P0 state of Pr3+ and from the 5D3 state of Tb3+ decreased with increasing pressure. At pressures greater than 50Â kbar, the 1D2Â âÂ 3HJ transitions in Pr3+ and the 5D4Â âÂ 7FJ transitions in Tb3+ dominated the spectra. At pressures greater than 100Â kbar, only emissions from the lower excited states were observed. At pressures greater than 150Â kbar, luminescence from the 1D2 and 5D4 states also decreased with increasing pressure, and at a pressure of 315Â kbar for CaWO4:Pr3+ and 190Â kbar for CaWO4:Tb3+, the emissions related to the Pr3+ and Tb3+ were quenched. These effects were related to the influence of impurity trapped excitons (ITEs) on the efficiency of the fâf emission in the Pr3+ and Tb3+ ions. Analysis of the emission spectra collected at different pressures allowed the energies of the ground states of the Pr3+ and Tb3+ ions with respect to the band edges of the CaWO4 host to be estimated. },

Subsequently, for the thin films of different thicknesses at different applied voltages, the variations of the current density with dose have been obtained. The current density increases near linearly with the gamma radiation dose up to a critical radiation dose, a dose value higher for the thicker films and decreases thereafter. The sensitivities of these TeO2 thin films at different applied voltages have been found to be in the range 1.2â37.0Â nA/cm2/Î¼Gy. Correspondingly, the detection limits have also been estimated and have been found to be in the range 0.22â2.16Â mGy. Clearly, the TeO2 thin films have high potential for their use as real-time gamma radiation dosimeters in monitoring the gamma radiation doses under a variety of practical situations involving low level to high level of the doses. },

The property of thin \{RPL\} glass plate was investigated by an \{RPL\} readout system based on a laser scanning microscope and a photon counting detector. The spatial resolving power of \{RPL\} image mapping was about 3Â Î¼m, owing to the limitation of laser spot size. Absorbed dose for low-energy photons generated from a 25Â kV X-ray tube was effectively measured with a set of thin \{RPL\} glass plates. In a microscopic dose measurement, \{RPL\} images for alpha-rays were obtained using thin \{RPL\} glass plates. The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of \{RPL\} intensity was related to the determining \{RPL\} from photoluminescence. The use of thin \{RPL\} glass plate effectively improved the S/N ratio owing to reduction of the fraction of intrinsic photoluminescence in the photon counting. Therefore, the highest-contrast image for alpha-ray irradiation was successfully obtained with the thinnest \{RPL\} glass plate. },

  Abstract                 = {Neutron-sensitive glass dosimeters were successfully made from reagents of NaPO3, Al(PO3)3, enriched 10 or 11B2O3 and AgCl. The glass dosimeters had good \{RPL\} characteristics: satisfactory linearity of 0.01â500Â mGy and low variation in sensitivity. The \{RPL\} characteristics for gamma-rays were compatible with those of a commercial glass dosimeter. A pair of the 10 or 11B-containing glass dosimeters was effectively used for the thermal neutron dosimetry. In 565Â keV and 5.0Â MeV monoenergetic neutron calibration fields, albedo neutrons from the \{ISO\} water slab phantom were successfully detected with the glass dosimeter pairs. },

  Abstract                 = {Biological dosimeters are recommended for dose estimation in case of human overexposure to ionising radiation. Rapid measurement of Î³-H2AX foci as a marker of \{DNA\} double-strand breaks (DSB) induction has been recently tested with this purpose. Here we reported a dose-response relationship after X-ray irradiation at different times post-exposure. Blood samples were obtained from several healthy donors and exposed to doses between 0 and 2Â Gy. After irradiation, blood samples were incubated at 37Â Â°C during 0.5Â h, 5Â h, and 8Â h. Scoring of cells and Î³-H2AX foci was performed by software. The dose-response curves for different incubation times were as follows: Y(0.5h)Â =Â 11.66DÂ +Â 0.15 (R2Â =Â 0.99), Y(5h)Â =Â 2.44DÂ +Â 0.15 (R2Â =Â 0.99), Y(8h)Â =Â 1.57DÂ +Â 0.22 (R2Â =Â 0.99). At 0.5Â h post-exposure, the dose-response relationship for X-irradiated lymphocytes was similar to the one obtained after gamma-irradiation using the same protocol. On the other hand, the results were not similar after 8Â h due to different kinetics after gamma- and X-irradiation. Our results confirm the possibilities of using Î³-H2AX foci method for dose estimation in a period from 0.5Â h up to 8Â h post X-irradiation and support the hypothesis of differences in Î³-H2AX foci kinetics after gamma- and X-irradiation inÂ vitro. },

Thermal quenching, if present, decreases intensity of luminescence at elevated temperatures. Therefore, with increasing heating rate, we expect decrease of the total number of emitted photons.

  Abstract                 = {The response to any radiation accident or incident involving actual or potential ionising radiation exposure requires accurate and rapid assessment of the doses received by individuals. The techniques available today for biodosimetry purposes are not fully adapted to rapid high-throughput measurements of exposures in large numbers of individuals. A recently emerging technique is based on gene expression analysis, as there are a number of genes which are radiation responsive in a dose-dependent manner. The present work aimed to assess a new technique which allows the detection of the level of expression of up to 800 genes without need of enzymatic reactions. In order to do so, human peripheral blood was exposed exÂ vivo to a range of x-ray doses from 5Â mGy to 4Â Gy of x-rays and the transcriptional expression of five radiation-responsive genes PHPT1, PUMA, CCNG1, \{DDB2\} and \{MDM2\} was studied by both the nCounter Digital Analyzer and Multiplex Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (MQRT-PCR) as the benchmark technology. Results from both techniques showed good correlation for all genes with \{R2\} values ranging between 0.8160 and 0.9754. The reproducibility of the nCounter Digital Analyzer was also assessed in independent biological replicates and proved to be good. Although the slopes of the correlation of results obtained by the techniques suggest that MQRT-PCR is more sensitive than the nCounter Digital Analyzer, the nCounter Digital Analyzer provides sensitive and reliable data on modifications in gene expression in human blood exposed to radiation without enzymatic amplification of \{RNA\} prior to analysis. },

  Abstract                 = {Optical bleaching of the thermoluminescence (TL) curve of K2YF5:Pr3+ has been observed after optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) readout of pre-irradiated crystals. The traps being responsible for the \{TL\} signal are not emptied completely by the optical stimulation. Furthermore, if the illumination time is increased a constant intensity level of the residual \{TL\} glow curve is eventually achieved. On the other hand, if the low temperature peak of the glow curve is thermally cleaned, no subsequent \{OSL\} is measured. This behavior has been successfully explained by assuming that part of the electrons in the trap being responsible for the low temperature glow peak of K2YF5:Pr3+ recombine with holes via localized transitions during optical stimulation. During \{TL\} all trapped electrons recombine via delocalized transitions. Simulations have been carried out in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the model. },

Measurements and Monte Carlo simulations were also compared with the \{MGD\} calculated using the Automatic Exposure Control (AEC) system of the mammographic unit. In the simulations the Doppler energy broadening effect was also taken into account. The simulated \{ESD\} are about 5%â10% higher than the measured \{ESD\} values. The deviation between the measured and simulated \{MGD\} values in the phantom is of about 15%. The \{MGD\} evaluated using the \{AEC\} system is smaller both with respect to the Monte Carlo simulation and experimental result by a factor of about 15% and 25% respectively. Moreover the BackScatter Factor (BSF) estimated by Monte Carlo simulations was used for the \{MGD\} calculation according to the Wuâs method. Finally the inclusion of the energy broadening effect on \{MGD\} calculation produces negligible variations on the simulated results. },

Furthermore a detailed investigation on primary electron and secondary bremsstrahlung photon transport from 90Y to speed up the calculations was performed.

One of the \{ORAMED\} Working Tasks is addressed to the discussion and implementation in the radiation protection practice of the eye lens equivalent dose. The aim of this task group is to develop a personal dosemeter characterized in term of Hp(3). Until now Hp(3) conversion coefficients were not reported in the official recommendations and the available data were calculated for a 30Â ÃÂ 30Â ÃÂ 15Â cm3 slab phantom that is far away to represent the head. A reduced slab phantom, for both calculating the quantities and type testing personal dosemeter in terms of the operational quantity, was previously proposed by \{ENEA\} Bologna team. The study demonstrated that a reduced slab phantom is better representative of a real situation, but the angular dependence of Hp(3,Î±) due to the edges of the slab reduces its applicability. Therefore a better-suited phantom is proposed here. The dosimetric assessment in terms of this quantity is seldom performed in the various workplaces (e.g. hospitals) and therefore a question rises about its usefulness and practical implementation. The present work tries to introduce new elements in the discussion on the quantity Hp(3) and to propose a more suitable theoretical cylindrical phantom (and a corresponding experimental one for the calibration procedures) to better approximate the head in which the eyes are placed. },

  Abstract                 = {Twenty samples of natural building materials commonly employed as ornamental stones in the international market have been investigated for natural radioactivity. External (gamma), as defined and used by the European Commission, and internal (alpha) hazard indexes were calculated and radon specific exhalation rate and emanation fraction were measured. The radiological investigation was complemented by an integrated mineralogical-petrographic and rock characterization approach. The most common radioactive accessory minerals occurring in the investigated samples are apatite, zircon and allanite, with minor monazite, thorite, thorianite, \{REE\} and Zr-oxides. Significant correlations with total activity concentration have been observed for K2O, Th and Ce concentrations. The emanation fraction is also influenced by both total porosity and porosity distribution. Radon exhalation rate and emanation fraction are very variable ranging from 0.0011 to 0.64Â BqÂ kgâ1Â hâ1 and from 0.2 to 62%, respectively. Most of the materials have radiological hazard indexes that do not exceed the European Commission limit values when used as ornamental or paving or flooring stones. However, three volcanic (Tufo Giallo Riano, Tufo Grigio Riano and Peperino Viterbese) samples could cause significant exposure both from excess radon indoor concentration (&gt;200Â BqÂ m3) and from gamma radiation (&gt;1Â mSvÂ yâ1) when used as structural materials. This study further indicates that limit values for hazard indexes based on natural activity concentration and Rn emanation should take into account the lithological properties and use of the materials. },

Proton collisions with the water molecules are estimated around the Bragg peak region, taking into account ionization, excitation, charge-changing processes, and energetic secondary electron behavior. The Bragg peak profile and position was determined by adopting a new approach involving discretization, incrementation, and dividing the target into layers, the thickness of each layer being selected randomly from a distribution weighted by the values of the total interaction cross section, from excitation up to ionization of the target and the incident projectile charge exchange. The calculation was carried out by a Monte-Carlo simulation in the energy range 20Â â¤Â EÂ â¤Â 108Â eV, including the relativistic corrections. },

In this work we report a study by cw and pulsed \{EPR\} on two samples of human tooth enamel respectively irradiated by \{UV\} (254Â nm) and Î³-exposed. The continuous wave (cw) \{EPR\} spectra have shown the usual presence in both samples of two types of \{CO\} 2 â radicals, with axial and orthorombic gÂ tensors. We have obtained the electron spin echo detected \{EPR\} (ED-EPR) spectra at 80Â K of the two samples, and we have shown that they are suitable to mark the difference between the effects produced by the different irradiations. At low temperature the contribution to the ED-EPR spectrum of the mobile radical with the axial g tensor is still present in the \{UV\} irradiated sample, but not in the Î³-irradiated one, where its dynamics is too slow to average the g tensor. We have moreover studied the two-pulse electron spin echo decay on varying the microwave power, a well established method for measuring the Instantaneous Diffusion. We have found that the spectral diffusion parameter is almost the same for both radiation types, whereas the Instantaneous Diffusion is significantly larger for Î³-exposed samples than for \{UV\} irradiated ones. This difference is due to a higher local microscopic concentration of free radicals for samples irradiated with Î³ photons. },

The samples have been irradiated in water-equivalent plastic phantom with a linear accelerator used for radiotherapy. After exposure watch glass samples have been cut in small strip-shaped pieces with suitable size to be put into the quartz tube for \{ESR\} measurements.

The detectors were irradiated in a water phantom with 6Â MV X-ray beams from linac and read with a dedicated \{TLD\} reader. Dose distributions of differently shaped fields and of a full stereotactic plan were measured and compared with planned distributions. Maximum distance-to-agreement (DTA) in the penumbra region was 1Â mm for both LiF:Mg,Cu,P and CaSO4:Dy \{TL\} sheets, for all the measured fields. Maximum percentage dose difference (DA%) between planned and measured dose value in low dose gradient regions was up to 11% for LiF:Mg,Cu,PÂ TL sheets and 18% for CaSO4:Dy \{TL\} sheets. Concerning the full stereotactic plan, the percentage of points with Î³-index below 1 is 54.9% for the LiF:Mg,Cu,P-based foil and 96.9% for the CaSO4:Dy \{TL\} sheets. Both 2D \{TL\} detector types can be considered to be a promising tool for bi-dimensional dose measurements in radiotherapy. Non-homogeneity, presumably due to the \{TL\} sheets manufacture, still affects dosimetric distribution and the agreement between planned and measured distributions may depend on the chosen sample. },

In particular, whole body and extremity monitoring is reported and related with the workload. The study shows that doses not only depend on the amount of activity injected but also on the type of animals and radiotracers managed. The extremities, with a great variability of the doses received, are the limiting organs as far as regulatory dose limits for workers are concerned. Mean Hâ(10) rates in contact and at 20Â cm from the animals, when they are handled by the technologist, range from around 1Â mSv/h to 20Â Î¼Sv/h, respectively. },

Basic sediment cases, as well as a model of a micro-stratified sediment from the Mas d'Azil cave have been modeled at a few centimeters scale. The results of the simulations have highlighted different factors having a significant impact on the beta dose rate dispersion, among which the heterogeneity of the radioactive elements, the distribution of grains in the matrix and their proportion in the sample. These factors contribute to enlarge beta dose distributions and even create complex ones, and inevitably induce errors in the dating process. These effects are discussed, as well as the potential of the simulation to calculate beta dose rates in sediment samples and the necessity of using sampling protocols adapted to sediment complexity. },

  Abstract                 = {Cytogenetic indicators are widely used in radiobiology to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation since dicentric chromosomes (Dic) are almost exclusively induced by ionizing radiation, and spontaneous frequency of Dic is very low in the healthy general population (about one Dic per 1000 cells). A particular interest of biodosimetry has been not only to obtain absorbed dose estimates using adequate calibration curves, under the assumption that all individuals respond equally to radiation-induced chromosome aberrations, but also to find a way to demonstrate inter-individual radiosensitivity and a possible correlation with age and gender. Thus, the objective of this preliminary work was the evaluation of the influence of age and gender on the outcome of cytogenetic biomarkers after Î³-irradiation. Samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes from six healthy, non-smoker, donors from both genders (three men and three women), in the range of 20 to 49 years, were irradiated with doses from 0Â Gy to 3Â Gy air kerma, using a 60Co gamma rays source with a dose rate from 170â180Â mGy/min. A clear dose-dependent increase in terms of aberrant cells excluding gaps (ACEG) and Dic was observed for all donors. Our preliminary results suggest, in the higher dose level evaluated (3Â Gy), a larger intervariability among individuals for Dic, with females apparently more sensitive than males (P&lt;0.05). Considering the different age groups, male donors showed a decrease, with age, for Dic and \{ACEG\} at the higher dose and also, for the background level, in case of ACEG. Future work will consider the study of more individuals, from both genders and different ages, in order to verify if this tendency persists and to enable the implementation of a dose-response calibration curve at Instituto TecnolÃ³gico e Nuclear for the Portuguese population, to quantify the biological dose in case of a radiological accident or emergency. },

The peak-to-peak height (PPH) measurement of the \{EPR\} signal is studied as a function of the absorbed gamma dose in the range 0.1â58Â kGy.

Measurements were performed in air, using the \{NIST\} \{M200\} beam (200 kV operating voltage). The air kerma at the dosimeter surface was measured with a free-air chamber, with combined uncertainty between 0.06% and 0.08% in air kerma rate. A careful protocol was followed to deconvolute glow curves into individual peaks. Results indicate stronger supralinearity (maxima higher than 10) for high-temperature (6aâ9) than for low-temperature (4â5) peaks. Comparing with the response induced by 60Co gamma rays, the region where the \{TL\} response is linear extends to higher doses for 100 keV X-rays than for gammas. The maximum dose response functions are much smaller for 100 keV X-rays than for 60Co (for instance, 40 vs. 232 for peak 8). The dose response function measured in this work was used as a reference radiation for Modified Track Structure Theory, MTST, calculations aimed at describing relative \{TL\} efficiency for a variety of intermediate energy ions. The ions secondary electron spectra are better matched to this reference radiation than to 8 keV or 1.25 MeV, previously used as references. The use of 100 keV X-rays has not improved the agreement between calculations and the ion-efficiency data. },

A new version of BANG-gel coupled with a small format laser \{CT\} scanner has been used. Measurements were performed with 100Â Î¼m resolution in all dimensions. In particular, radial dose function and absorbed dose rate in the plane parallel to the sources longitudinal-axis were derived at radial distances smaller than or equal to 1Â cm. In addition, the energy dependence was evaluated, finding that, within measurement uncertainties, the gel response is independent of the energy for energy photon values between 20Â keV and 1250Â keV. We have observed that at distances larger than 1.4Â mm from the source, the delivered dose is similar to predictions from published Monte Carlo calculations (MC) for the 125I seed. For distances between 1Â mm and 3Â mm, differences in magnitude and shape are significant for the 103Pd seed, where an enhancement is observed. In the enhancement region, a difference of up to 70% in the radial dose function was obtained. Such observation suggests a contribution from other radionuclides emitting beta-particles or electrons, and not considered by MC. To understand the effect, spectrometry measurements were performed. A small contribution of 102Rh/102mRh radionuclide relative to 103Pd was observed and its importance on the absorbed dose measured at close distances to the seed is time dependent and consequently, avoids reproducible measurements. Finally, the results obtained in this work underscore the importance of using high-spatial-resolution and water-equivalent detectors for measuring absorbed dose in low-energy photon radiation fields. },

When identical beam width and pitch factor were selected, the breast dose tended to be low using z-axis modulation compared with fixed mA acquisition, and it also tended to be low using xyz-axis modulation compared with using z-axis modulation. The level of image noise in general was almost equal to the level that was preset when the \{AEC\} system was applied, but the level of image noise at the liver region under the right diaphragm tended to be low. Thus, the \{AEC\} system is effective for the reduction of the radiation dose to the breasts while maintaining appropriate image quality in abdominal \{CT\} examinations. },

In all of these areas a constant balance has to be made between the treatment necessary to destroy the tumor and the unnecessary exposure of healthy tissue. Innovative applications of \{OSL\} dosimetry are now appearing in each of these areas to help the medical physicist and oncologist design the most effective, and least deleterious, treatment for their patients. High sensitivity, precise delivery of light, fast readout times, simpler readers and easier automation are the main advantages of \{OSL\} in comparison with TLD. This work aimed to study the application of \{OSL\} technique using lithium fluoride dosimeters doped with magnesium and titanium (LiF:Mg,Ti) for application in beta and gamma dosimetry. },

Therefore, it is important that radiation exposure of the different radiation of \{LET\} is monitored. In this paper, the evaluation methods of \{DNA\} lesions caused by high-LET radiation using the polymerase chain reaction are descried. We found that the efficiency of \{DNA\} synthesis decreased with increasing \{LET\} through experiment of the analysis of the \{DNA\} lesion by the polymerase chain reaction.

The instruments used in the study were both active and passive, photon and neutron detectors calibrated either for ambient or personal dose equivalent. The aim of the measurement campaign was to compare the responses of the radiation instruments to routinely used detectors. It has been shown that especially the indications of the neutron detectors are strongly dependent on the neutron spectra around the cask due to their different energy responses. However, routinely used active photon and neutron detectors were shown to be reliable instruments. },

Basic operation features are reviewed in details by focusing on their determinant impact upon the definition of the consistent design parameters. Previous Monte Carlo simulations, where both wall effect and electron attachment effects due to occlusive electronegative impurities were taken in consideration, were carried out in 3He-filled proportional counters for the study of the pulse height distribution and gamma rays influence. From interpretation of the main quantitative results, basic parameters for design optimization requirements were drawn-up. Some laboratory developed 3He-based proportional counter prototypes are then described. The characteristics of a set of gas composition fillings that were experimentally investigated are then compared to those obtained with a commercial specimen that was taken as a reference standard. Finally, a brief conclusion underlines some consistent insights toward the improvement of quality performances during future development tasks of helium-filled proportional counters intended for thermal neutron detection and neutron spectrometry applications. },

This paper reviews some of the recent developments in radiation dosimetry that have been enabled by knowledge of the charge trapping and recombination processes occurring in \{OSLD\} materials during irradiation and stimulation. Although many materials have been and are currently being studied, this short review focuses on just two, namely carbon-doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C) and europium-doped potassium bromide (KBr:Eu). The defect structure and trapping/recombination mechanisms in these materials have led to application in several areas of radiation dosimetry and dose imaging. Two recent areas of development are in space dosimetry (for Al2O3:C) and in medical dosimetry (for KBr:Eu). This overview briefly describes these latter modern applications and relates the functionality of the \{OSLDs\} to their basic defect properties. },

  Abstract                 = {Naturally occurring radon 222Rn in indoor air is a significant cause of lung cancer and the houses are an important exposure location due to the large proportion of time spent at home. The indoor radon measurements have been carried out in some of the dwellings belonging to different villages of Fatehbad and Hisar districts of Western Haryana. LR-115 Type \{II\} plastic track detectors in bare mode were used for the measurement of indoor radon concentration for over a period of one year. The calculated annual average indoor radon concentration values vary from 126.3Â BqÂ mâ3 to 172.1Â BqÂ mâ3 with an average value of 145.21Â BqÂ mâ3, which is less than the recommended action level (200â300Â BqÂ mâ3). The values of annual effective dose vary from 2.16Â mSv to 2.94Â mSv which is less than the lower limit of the recommended action level (3â10Â mSv). The measured values of lifetime fatality risk vary from 1.67 to 2.27 with an average value of 1.92. The winter to summer ratio calculated for the studied dwellings ranges from 0.86 to 2.15 with an average of 1.46. The results indicate that the indoor radon concentration is higher in winter season than in the summer season. An attempt has also been made to find a correlation between the ventilation conditions and the measured values of indoor radon concentration. In most of the cases the radon values are less in well ventilated houses than partially/poorly ventilated houses. The measured indoor radon concentration values for the studied area are on the higher side than the world average of 40Â BqÂ mâ3. },

  Abstract                 = {LiMgPO4:Tb3+ phosphor was synthesized by solid state reaction. The thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) glow curve of Tb doped LiMgPO4 exhibits a main \{TSL\} peak at 170Â Â°C with shoulders at 100 and 260Â Â°C on either side of this peak. The \{TSL\} sensitivity of the phosphor was found to be about 2.5 times that of CaSO4:Dy phosphor. \{TSL\} emission and photoluminescence (PL) studies show that Tb3+ ion acts as luminescence centre in this phosphor. The kinetic parameters, namely activation energy (E) and frequency factor (s) associated with the main glow peak have been determined using peak shape method. The activation energy and frequency factor obtained are 1.35Â Â±Â 0.03Â eV and (6.53Â Â±Â 0.43)Â ÃÂ 1014Â sâ1 respectively.

These samples have been previously subjected to two different de-proteinization procedures, after applying hydrazine and sodium hydroxide. The \{OSL\} signal, when quantified based on the conventional way of \{OSL\} analysis, namely the use of the initial 5Â s of the signal minus the intensity of the last 5Â s as a background signal, yields bad signal to noise ratio as well as instability. The application of the de-convolution procedure including two components, one of general order kinetics and one of tunnelling recombination results to a fast \{OSL\} component with enhanced signal to noise ratio, isolating thus the fading component and yielding a linear dose response throughout the entire dose range of the present study. Finally, the physical meaningfulness of the fitting parameters for the tunnelling component, especially the dimensionless parameter representing the normalized donorâacceptor density Ïâ² is also discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating allows constraining the depositional age of sediments with good accuracy and precision. A fundamental requirement in \{OSL\} dating is to use purified sub-samples (i.e. mono-mineralogic aliquots composed of e.g. quartz or potassium feldspar only), because of the different \{OSL\} properties and dosimetry characteristics of each mineral phase. Where multiple mineral phases are present on an aliquot, a mixed \{OSL\} signal might be obtained, with potentially adverse effects on the robustness of the resulting optical ages. Detailed evaluation of the mineralogical composition of the hundreds or even thousands of individual mineral particles that constitute an aliquot in \{OSL\} dating has â until recently â not been reasonably feasible with current analytical techniques. Here we report on the use of an automated mineralogy system that combines scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and facilitates ultra-fast analysis of particulate mineral phases with a spatial resolution on the micron scale. The method is applied to mono-mineralogic coarse-grained (100â250Â Î¼m) and poly-mineral fine-grained (4â11Â Î¼m) \{OSL\} samples, respectively and cross-checked with electron probe micro analysis (EPMA). It is shown that (i) some coarse-grained mineral extracts that underwent standard physico-chemical preparation to isolate quartz for \{OSL\} dating, still suffer from mineralogical contamination, mainly in the form of feldspar and mica inclusions and, that (ii) polymineral fine-grained samples reveal a complex mineralogical composition with a significant percentage of mica (mainly muscovite). Implications of these quantitative mineralogical observations for \{OSL\} dating are discussed. \{QEMSCAN\} is further used to examine the efficiency of different physico-chemical preparation strategies to isolate a restricted range of mineralogies and to optimize single preparation steps. We conclude that the clear advantage of automated SEMâEDS systems lies in the rapidity with which accurate high-resolution maps of hundreds or even thousands of mineral particles can be generated, i.e. at a level statistically representative of the bulk \{OSL\} sample. Automated SEMâEDS techniques might thus be helpful in \{OSL\} dating for quality assurance and investigation of problematic \{OSL\} samples. },

  Abstract                 = {Accurate measurement of low dose radiation in complex systems is of utmost importance in radiation biology and related areas. Ferrous Benzoic acid Xylenol orange (FBX) system is being widely used for measurement of low dose gamma radiation because of its reproducibility and precision. However, an additional step, i.e., dissolution of benzoic acid in water at higher temperature followed by cooling at room temperature is involved for the preparation of this dosimeter. This makes it inconvenient as a ready to use dosimeter. In the present work, the organic molecule, sorbitol has been used for measurement of low doses of radiation. The advantages of using sorbitol are its ready availability and instantaneous water solubility. Owing to its dissolution at room temperature, possible errors those are involved in calculation of dose due to thermal oxidation of ferrous ions during preparation of the \{FBX\} dosimetric solution could be made insignificant in the proposed dosimeter. In the present system, sorbitol acts as radiolytic sensitizer for the oxidation of ferrous ion, and xylenol orange forms a 1:1 complex specifically with ferric ions. Thus, the analytical detection limit of ferric ions is enhanced compared to other systems. Final composition of the dosimetric solution is; 0.5Â mol/m3 xylenol orange, 10Â mol/m3 sorbitol and 0.2Â mol/m3 ferrous ion in 50Â mol/m3 sulfuric acid. Radiolytic sensitization in combination with analytical enhancement of the ferrous based system, allows us to measure radiation dose in the range of 0.05Â Gyâ12Â Gy with ease and high reproducibility. },

Six (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce crystal samples, with dimensions of 3Â ÃÂ 3Â ÃÂ 5, 3Â ÃÂ 3Â ÃÂ 6, 3Â ÃÂ 3Â ÃÂ 10, 3Â ÃÂ 3Â ÃÂ 15, 10Â ÃÂ 10Â ÃÂ 10 and 10Â ÃÂ 10Â ÃÂ 20Â mm3 were examined. The light emitted by the crystals, was evaluated by performing measurements of the \{AE\} under X-ray exposure conditions, with tube voltages ranging from 50 to 130Â kV. Results were compared with previously published data for GSO:Ce and LSO:Ce crystals. The spectral compatibility of the (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce crystal, with various existing optical detectors, was investigated after emission spectra measurements. Absolute efficiency was found maximum at 130Â kVp for the 3Â ÃÂ 3Â ÃÂ 15Â mm3 (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce crystal (25.40 E.U). \{AE\} of the 10Â ÃÂ 10Â ÃÂ 10Â mm3 (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce crystal was found higher than both GSO:Ce and LSO:Ce crystals, in the whole X-ray tube range. The emission spectrum of (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce is excellent matched with the spectral sensitivities of photocathodes and silicon photomultipliers often employed in radiation detectors. Considering the high luminescence efficiency values and the spectral compatibility with the various photodetectors, (Lu,Gd)2SiO5:Ce crystal could be considered for use in combined medical imaging detectors i.e. integrated PET/CT detectors. },

For most of measured points the adjustment for seasonal variation was necessary and had been conducted. Highest average values of indoor radon concentrations were found in rural settlements of Lipljan and Vitina regions, 512 and 452Â Bq/m3, respectively. Combined analysis allows indoor radon concentration of 220Â Bq/m3 to be suggested as representative estimate for Kosovo, while additional data appear.

In the experiments to be described, four types of prostate treatment were simulated: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT, 6Â MV), Tomotherapy (6Â MV), \{IMRT\} (6Â MV and 18Â MV), 5-field conformal radiotherapy (15Â MV) and 4-field conformal radiotherapy (6Â MV and 18Â MV). Irradiations were performed in two centres, University Hospital of Santa Chiara, Pisa, Italy and Centre of Oncology M. SkÅodowska-Curie Memorial Institute, Krakow, Poland. Whatever the difficulties and uncertainties in risk estimation, its foundation lies in the knowledge of the absorbed dose to the irradiated organs. Thus the measurement of out-of-field doses is a crucial pre-requisite for risk estimation and is the subject of the \{EURADOS\} Working Group 9. For photon out-of-field dose measurements TLD, \{OSL\} and \{RPL\} dosimeters were used. Comparison of dosimeters under the same irradiation conditions showed that dosimeters generally agreed to within 3% compared with ion chamber reference measurements. Other comparisons were possible with these data. They include a comparison of doses (beam profiles) in different positions in the \{BOMAB\} phantom, a comparison of different treatment modalities in the two contributing clinical centres (Pisa and Krakow) and a comparison of dose profiles resulting from the different treatment techniques and the corresponding doses calculated by the treatment planning systems used to generate the treatment plans. Finally, preliminary measurements of surface doses at selected points on the trunk of the \{BOMAB\} phantom were made using diode detectors. Comparison of out-of-field doses for different modalities in the two clinical centres shows that differences in out-of-field doses for the same Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) can be even a factor of 4. For sparing adjacent organs-at-risk the best results were obtained for IMRT. On the other hand the lowest out-of-field doses were for \{MLC\} conformal therapy. },

  Abstract                 = {Phototransfered thermoluminescence (PTTL) found its use in radiation dosimetry for dose reassessment primarily in photon radiation fields. After the dose has first been evaluated by a ânormalâ thermoluminescence (TL) measurement, the same detector is subjected to the \{PTTL\} dose reassessment procedure providing a new estimation by an independent measurement procedure. \{PTTL\} also gives a new possibility for a dose reassessment and for separate dose determination in the mixed fields. It was shown in our previous papers that it is possible to determine separately gamma and neutron dose components with a single detector due to different sensitivities of \{TL\} and subsequent \{PTTL\} to neutrons in comparison to gamma rays. The main disadvantage, the low sensitivity of both, \{TL\} and PTTL, to neutrons restricts the use only for the case of radiation accident. In this work we have investigated the possibilities of improvement the sensitivities of \{PTTL\} by heating the samples during \{UV\} irradiation and by using the sensitization technique involving a âpre-doseâ followed by annealing. Two types of LiF:Mg,Ti detectors, TLD-100 and TLD-700, were examined by irradiation in 137Cs gamma ray field and with neutrons of 14.5Â MeV. After \{UV\} irradiation at different temperatures, \{PTTL\} increases reaching the values 2.1 and 2.5 times higher at 90Â Â°C than that at 25Â Â°C for TLD-100 and TLD-700 respectively. Increasing level is approximately the same for gamma rays and neutrons. After sensitization, \{TL\} signal is one half of that before sensitization. \{PTTL\} signal has increased 11 times for gamma rays and 5 times for neutrons at 25Â Â°C with significant increase with increasing temperature during \{UV\} irradiation. },

  Abstract                 = {Gamma Knife radiosurgery stereotactically delivers a high single dose of external radiation to a small well-defined intracranial lesions. Due to a large amount of dose delivered in a single fraction (10â30Â Gy), dose outside the treatment volume is an important issue. The aim of the study was to measure the out-of-field doses during the Leksell Gamma Knife Model C radiosurgery for children. The children population was chosen due to their higher susceptibility to radiation. Also, due to smaller size of their bodies, the larger doses are expected to all out-of-field tissues and organs than for adults for the same irradiation conditions. The purpose was to identify doses delivered to the eye lens, thyroid glands, breasts, sternum, upper abdomen and gonads from the doses measured with dosimeters placed on the some positions on the surface of the patients. There were 5 patients between 4 and 14 years old. The relation of the organ doses and doses on the surface was determined by measurements using the anthropomorphic phantom (CIRS, ten-year old child). For dosimetry measurements two types of thermoluminescent dosimeters were used, LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P and radiophotoluminescent glass dosimeters type GD-352M. The agreement between three types of dosimeters was on average within 4%. Doses on the patients have shown large dissipation for the same positions above specified organs. This is due to different influential parameters (position and volume of the target, height and weight of patient, irradiation dose). For example, doses to the eyes and gonads varied from 0.7% to 2.55% and from 0.05% to 0.22% of the mean target dose, respectively. Results of organ dose measurements in the phantom and on the surface of the phantom show differences between 5 and 25% for different organs. Lifetime attributable risks of cancer incidence associated with a chosen Gamma Knife radiation treatment were calculated for selected radiosensitive organs. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents a method for a small, inexpensive mobile robot equipped with a single high resolution scintillation detector to quickly survey an area and convey information about local sources of gamma radiation to a remote human operator. This is achieved by surrounding the detector with a lead sheath that blocks all gamma-rays except those incident along the detector's axial direction. A 180Â° horizontal scan is performed by rotating the detector and a directional profile of gamma radiation is constructed. In addition, a 180Â° visual panorama of the local area is assembled using a camera mounted on the detector. A plot of the detector count rate versus angle is then overlaid on top of the visual panorama and visible peaks clearly indicate the direction of local gamma radiation sources. Measuring the energy spectrum of gamma-rays in each direction produces a 2D count frequency histogram where distinct peaks indicate the energy and direction of local gamma-ray sources allowing the identification of different radio-isotopes. The mobile robot can use the peaks as goal directions and autonomously move towards gamma-ray sources. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this study, all available data on the largest solar proton events (SPEs), or extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events, for the period from 1561 up to now are analyzed. Under consideration are the observational, methodological and physical problems of energy-spectrum presentation for \{SEP\} fluxes (fluences) near the Earth's orbit. Special attention is paid to the study of the distribution function for extreme fluences of \{SEPs\} by their sizes. The authors present advances in at least three aspects: 1) a form of the distribution function that was previously obtained from the data for three cycles of solar activity has been completely confirmed by the data for 41 solar cycles; 2) early estimates of extremely large fluences in the past have been critically revised, and their values were found to be overestimated; and 3) extremely large \{SEP\} fluxes are shown to obey a probabilistic distribution, so the concept of an âupper limit fluxâ does not carry any strict physical sense although it serves as an important empirical restriction. \{SEP\} fluxes may only be characterized by the relative probabilities of their appearance, and there is a sharp break in the spectrum in the range of large fluences (or low probabilities). It is emphasized that modern observational data and methods of investigation do not allow, for the present, the precise resolution of the problem of the spectrum break or the estimation of the maximum potentialities of solar accelerator(s). This limitation considerably restricts the extrapolation of the obtained results to the past and future for application to the epochs with different levels of solar activity. },

The NL-OSL method was suggested to be useful in studying traps having relatively low and closely lying values of photoionization cross-section. The possible advantage of NL-OSL over LM-OSL technique was also discussed. In present studies the experimental values of signal to noise ratio have been compared for NL-OSL and LM-OSL modes of stimulation using Î±-Al2O3: C phosphor. The experimental results show definite advantage of NL-OSL over LM-OSL and CW-OSL, as NL-OSL technique has been found to be useful in separating fast \{OSL\} component more effectively, thus leading to extended dose linearity from the \{OSL\} defects having larger photoionization cross-section, particularly in Î±-Al2O3: C, with added feature of multiple dose assessment for single irradiation. },

Signals measured at X-band (â¼9.5Â GHz) by three \{EPR\} methods: conventional slow-scan field-modulated EPR, rapid scan EPR, and pulsed EPR, were compared. To acquire spectra with comparable signal-to-noise, both pulsed and rapid scan \{EPR\} require less time than conventional \{CW\} EPR. Rapid scan spectroscopy does not require the high power amplifiers that are needed for pulsed EPR.

  Abstract                 = {Seventeen domestic and scientific glass specimens were investigated for thermoluminescence (TL) properties suitable for application to retrospective population dosimetry. Usefulness for retrospective dosimetry was initially judged by the presence of well-defined \{TL\} glow peaks and the absence of irradiation-independent luminescence. Of particular interest were \{TL\} glow peaks having relatively low trap depths, to prevent significant natural dose accumulation. Minimum useful trap lifetimes would be in the order of weeks. Surveys were undertaken to observe the \{TL\} and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) behaviour of each sample. Most samples showed identifiable TL, with Pyrex in particular, and samples from a jar, a lampshade, and opaque blue beads all showing well-defined \{TL\} glow peaks with sensitivities that were not significantly affected by prior irradiation and heating of the sample. Kinetic analysis of these samples showed that their \{TL\} emission originates from traps with suitable stability for retrospective dosimetry. It is concluded that, while some glass samples show promising results, the inherent variability of an amorphous substance such as glass means that the suitability of each sample must be determined on a case-by-case basis. },

The main objective of this work has been to assess the feasibility of using these crystals as detectors for fiberoptic radioluminescent dosimetry. In particular, it has been found that the \{RL\} intensity from both K2YF5:Tb (10%) and \{K2TbF5\} is comparable to that from a commercial Al2O3:C crystal. Longer wavelength emission from these fluorides makes simple optical filtering technique possible to use in order to avoid the stem effect. Afterglow decay times for these fluorides have been found to be similar to that for Al2O3:C and, in particular, \{K2TbF5\} does not show longer afterglow decay time compared to Al2O3:C. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the \{EPR\} spectra of the radicals induced in oyster shells after irradiation to (0.5â2) kGy ionizing radiation doses are analyzed. \{EPR\} spectra of irradiated shells showed the complex radical composition of biocarbonates, characterized by the presence of SO2â, SO3â and CO2â radicals with different symmetries. In particular, the radiation-induced line at gÂ =Â 2.0038, due to the gx component of the orthorhombic SO3â, was well distinguishable from the rest of the spectrum. The gx component of the orthorhombic SO3â was found to be intense and stable enough to allow the identification at least for the whole shelf life of the oyster. Furthermore, it is still well visible at low microwave powers for which the other signals are weak or non-visible and has a linear dose response in the (0.5â2) kGy range. A possible procedure protocol for the identification of irradiated oysters, can be based on acquisitions of the spectrum at low microwave power values (tenths of milliWatt) and low modulation amplitude values (0.03â0.05Â mT) and on the identification of the gÂ =Â 2.0038 signal as a proof of the ionizing radiation treatment performed on the sample. },

The goal of the present work is the dosimetric characterization of mineral silicates extracted from the plant Hibiscus Sabdariffa L, known as Jamaica flower, in the dose range 0.5â5Â Gy. By studying the radiation-induced signal in time, the temperature integration region between 210Â Â°C and 250Â Â°C was found to be the most stable and also reduced the effects of thermal fading in the dose reconstruction process; the dose response curve was linear between 0.5Â Gy and 5Â Gy. By checking the change in sensitivity after repeated exposures to ionizing radiations and to high temperature heating, no variation in the glow curve shape or peak intensities were detected. To eliminate a pre-existing background signal, all the characterization measurements were performed with aliquots âannealedâ by a preliminary readout of the TL. },

  Abstract                 = {In Spain, a recent modification in the regulations of protection against ionizing radiation obligates to determine radon levels in particular workplaces like spas, mines and caves. Most of these workplaces may present extreme measurement conditions like high aerosol content, temperature, and humidity that can affect the radon detector response. In our laboratory we use to determine mean radon activity concentration in air with the nuclear track detector Makrofol \{DE\} covered with an aluminized Mylar foil and placed within the FzK \{FN\} diffusion chamber with a glass fibre filter. We have compared detector response using different filter configurations in common laboratory ambient conditions. The configuration with a better response (polyethylene filter) and our reference configuration took part in a study of the effect of different temperature and humidity on our detector response carried out in the \{INTE\} radon chamber. Results obtained did not show a significant difference between detector responses with both filters. However, when we exposed them for long periods to real environmental conditions at underground sites we could observe Mylar deterioration. To look in detail into a possible effect of long-term high-humidity exposures we exposed nine sets of detectors with three different polyethylene bags, first five sets under controlled conditions in the \{INTE\} radon chamber and then four sets in long-term exposures at high humidity environments. We have seen that the Mylar foil can be damaged depending on the duration of exposure. In a radon chamber exposure time is normally limited to a few days for practical and financial reasons; therefore, results do not show if humidity affects the glass fibre filter and detectors response. To analyse it we exposed detectors in a real humid environment up to a month where we already observed Mylar deterioration due to humidity but the possible impact on track density is hidden by the scattering of the results found, so a clear conclusion cannot be stated. },

The radiation chemical yields for the losses of ether and carbonate ester bonds are hardly affected by the environmental conditions in the cases of He and C ion irradiations. For gamma ray, the yields are about half in vacuum compared to those in air. The formation of \{OH\} groups is fairly suppressed in vacuum in all cases.

Chemical damage parameters like the damage density, the effective track core radius and the radiation chemical yields, G values (scissions/100Â eV), for each bond are also derived. We have found anomalous dependence of these parameters on the stopping power. The G value for the loss of carbonate ester bond decreased from 20 for proton down to 5 for C and Ne ions, and then increased with atomic number of heavy ions up to 8 for Xe ion. Radial dose distribution for each ion has been also calculated.

  Abstract                 = {Although several cases of radiation-induced skin injury (RSI) have been reported in association with neurointerventional procedures, such as endovascular embolization for cerebral aneurysm, the absorbed doses are not directly measured in most cases. We therefore built a direct measurement system in order to simplify determination of the entrance skin dose (ESD) during neurointerventional procedures. This system was then applied to patients undergoing long and repetitive procedures in order to establish the efficacy of precise mapping of \{ESDs\} using a number of radiophotoluminescence glass dosimeters (RPLDs) and to avoid RSI. We also analyzed the correlation between maximum \{ESDs\} and angiographic parameters in order to estimate maximum \{ESD\} in real-time. \{ESD\} was measured in 35 procedures in 34 cerebral aneurysm patients with a median age of 65 years (range, 38â79 years). Patients were measured for \{ESDs\} while wearing a fitted dosimetry cap equipped with 60 \{RPLD\} chips throughout the procedure. Angiographic parameters, including total fluoroscopic time and dose-area product (DAP), were recorded. The Pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationship between maximum \{ESD\} and each parameter. Five of thirty-five procedures showed temporal epilation (14.3%). The correlations between a patientâs maximum \{ESD\} and total fluoroscopic time and \{DAP\} were rÂ =Â 0.7372, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001 and rÂ =Â 0.6698, PÂ &lt;Â .001, respectively. We concluded that the regional \{ESD\} with geometric information could be obtained by applying the RPLDs. Although this passive dosimetry system may not entirely prevent \{RSI\} in real-time, precise dose mapping accompanied by monitoring of angiographic parameters during the procedure should contribute to reducing X-ray dose accumulation in repeated prophylactic endovascular embolization for asymptomatic cerebral aneurysm. },

  Abstract                 = {Time-resolved infra-red stimulated luminescence (TR-IRSL) technique enables an understanding of the dynamics of trapped electrons after \{IR\} excitation in the band-tail states of feldspar. This work intends to study the underlying physical mechanism of \{IRSL\} production. TR-IRSL studies were carried out on four feldspar mineral specimens of variable chemical composition and structural state. Assuming the \{IR\} excited trapped electrons make random walks in the band-tail states and recombine by tunnelling dynamically, hopping time is derived from the \{OFF\} time data of TR-IRSL. This analysis indicates that the hopping time decreases with stimulation temperature. Using Einstein diffusion equation, hopping probability is computed and is shown to obey the equation describing variable range hopping mechanism of Mott kind. Mott's parameters (hopping length and hopping energy) are then derived. Hopping length decreases with stimulation temperature whereas hopping energy increases with temperature. The average hopping length and energy are in the range of 11â18Â Ã and 45â55Â meV respectively and the diffusion constant is estimated to be in the range of 10â10â10â9Â cm2Â sâ1 for all the feldspar samples. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Loess deposits are one of the most important sources of information about palaeoclimatic changes for the whole Quaternary. In general, loess is typical for cold and dry, periglacial climate and environment. The intercalated palaeosols are indicators of warmer and more humid climate representing interstadials or interglacials. In Poland, loess and loess-like formations occur in the southern part of the country, mostly in the south Polish uplands, i.e. in the Lublin, Sandomierz, and Cracow Uplands. In addition, such deposits are found in the forelands and foothills of the Carpathians and Sudetes. Luminescence dating is one of the leading techniques to establish chronologies for loess-palaeosol sequences and has been successfully applied to different minerals and grain size fractions by several research groups. \{OSL\} chronostratigraphy over the last two decades became very popular especially for loess deposits around the world, meaning that there are hundreds of new luminescence dates associated with those deposits. Our investigation is focused on the determination of chronostratigraphy for Polish loess deposits from the last glacial cycle in \{SE\} Poland up to about 130 ka. Twenty-one samples from the loess profile in ZÅota (21Â°39â²E, 50Â°39â²N) were collected for luminescence dating and six for 14C dating. Two different fractions were investigated, the polymineral fine grains (4â11Â Î¼m) and silt-sized quartz grains (45â63Â Î¼m). In addition, analyses of the magnetic susceptibility, grain-size distribution, carbonate and organic carbon content were conducted. Although further investigations are needed, our results show the suitability of the Polish loess for \{OSL\} dating and very good agreement between obtained luminescence and 14C dating results. },

  Abstract                 = {A numerical approach based on image processing was developed to simulate a particle track in a typical polymeric detector, e.g., polycarbonate, under electrochemical etching. The physical parameters such as applied voltage, detector thickness, track length, the radii of curvature at the tip of track, and the incidence angle of the particle were considered, and then the boundary condition of the problem was defined. A numerical method was developed to solve Laplace equation, and then the distribution of the applied voltage was obtained through the polymer volume. Subsequently, the electric field strengths in the detector elements were computed. In each step of the computation, an image processing technique was applied to convert the computed values to grayscale images. The results showed that a numerical solution to Laplace equation is dedicatedly an attractive approach to provide us the accurate values of electric field strength through the polymeric detector volume as well as the track area. According to the results, for a particular condition of the detector thickness equal to 445Â Î¼m, track length of 21Â Î¼m, the radii of 2.5Â Î¼m at track tip, the incidence angle of 90Â°, and the applied voltage of 2080Â V, after computing Laplace equation for an extremely high population of 4000Â ÃÂ 4000 elements of detector, the average field strength at the tip of track was computed equal to 0.31Â MVÂ cmâ1 which is in the range of dielectric strength for polymers. The results by our computation confirm Smytheâs model for estimating the ECE-tracks. },

The luminescence properties of Ce3+ and Dy3+, and the energy transfer from Ce3+ to Dy3+ were investigated. The Ce3+ species in LiAl5O8 emit one broad band that peaks at 351Â nm under the excitation of ultraviolet light, which is attributed to the 5dâ4f transitions of Ce3+. The luminescence of Dy3+ in singly doped LiAl5O8 can not be detected due to its low oscillator strength. However, Dy3+ emit intense blue (477Â nm) and yellow (569Â nm) light after the introduction of Ce3+. This phenomenon demonstrates that there exists effective energy transfer from Ce3+ to Dy3+, which occurs because the emission spectrum of Ce3+ perfectly overlays the excitation spectrum of Dy3+. The energy transfer from Ce3+ to Dy3+ is performed through dipoleâdipole interactions. The experimental results show that LiAl5O8 co-doped with Ce3+ and Dy3+ can be a potential two-band (blue and yellow) phosphor. },

This unique phenomenon was utilized to develop a microdosimeter using the common LiF (TLD-700) and BeO (American Beryllia-CF5427-000) dosimeter chips. The dosimeter pairs were exposed to complex mixed radiation fields produced by bombarding a polystyrene plate phantom with therapeutic proton beams of energies from 81 to 231Â MeV at the West German Proton Therapy Centre Essen (WPE), Germany. The linear energy transfer (LET) and quality factor (Q) of the secondary radiation fields were simultaneously estimated using a \{REM\} 500B tissue equivalent proportional counter (TEPC). The \{TLD\} chips were evaluated and the corresponding \{LET\} and Q values were plotted as linear functions of the ratio of the TL-glow curve areas within 100â250Â Â°C of TLD-700 and BeO chips. The \{TLD\} pairs embody a passive, solid-state, tissue-equivalent, microdosimeter that enable the delivery of dose equivalent (DE), dose-average \{LET\} and Q within a broad dynamic range for a given mixed-radiation field relevant to particle therapy, long haul aviation dose monitoring and human space exploration. },

  Abstract                 = {Proton therapy is capable of delivering the planned dose more conformally to the tumour volume, reducing the dose to surrounding healthy tissue in comparison to conventional photon radiotherapy. However, secondary fast neutrons and gamma rays are produced due to the interaction of the primary proton beam with the beam shaping and modifying devices inside the beam delivery nozzle as well as the patient themselves, resulting in an unwanted radiation exposure to sensitive organs located outside the treatment volume. At the Westdeutsches Protonentherapiezentrum Essen (WPE) we have explicitly estimated the neutron and gamma dose equivalents at the outer surfaces of a 26Â ÃÂ 26Â ÃÂ 32Â cm3 polystyrene plate phantom irradiated with a 226Â MeV scanned proton pencil beam using commercially available Î±-Al2O3:C (TLD-500) and 7LiF:Ti, Mg (TLD-700) dosimeter pairs. The scanned volume in the phantom and the delivered proton dose were 1Â L (10Â ÃÂ 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm3) and 10.3Â Gy respectively. This small neutron and gamma dosimeter, based on existing \{TLD\} technology, will be implemented for inÂ vivo out-of-field dosimetry for patients receiving proton radiotherapy at \{WPE\} in the near future. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There is a need for large scale intercomparisons to determine the degree of coherence of luminescence dating measurements made by different laboratories. Here we describe results from a laboratory intercomparison sample based on a quartz-rich aeolian and/or coastal marine sand ridge from the Skagen peninsula, northern Jutland (Denmark). About 200Â kg of sand was sampled at night from a single beach ridge. The sand was homogenised using a cement mixer and packed in â¼700 moisture and light-tight bags for distribution. The quartz luminescence characteristics are satisfactory (e.g. fast-component dominated and good dose recovery) and our own equivalent dose determinations and measurements of radionuclide concentrations for twenty of these bags demonstrate the degree of homogenisation. One natural sample and one sample of pre-processed quartz was made available on request; analysis of all the responses gives a mean dose (pre-processed quartz) of 4.58Â Gy, ÏÂ =Â 0.40 (nÂ =Â 26), to be compared to the mean dose (self-extracted quartz) of 4.52Â Gy, ÏÂ =Â 0.55 (nÂ =Â 21). The mean age is 3.99Â Â±Â 0.14Â ka, ÏÂ =Â 0.71 (nÂ =Â 22), i.e. a relative standard deviation of 18%. We present an analysis of all the important quantitative and qualitative responses we received between 2007 and 2012 and discuss the implications for our dating community and for users of luminescence ages. },

  Abstract                 = {When dating older sedimentary deposits using quartz, there are no unambiguous methods for identifying the presence of incomplete bleaching. Current statistical analysis of dose distributions depends entirely on the assumption that incomplete bleaching and mixing are the main causes of any excess dispersion in the distribution; the only existing way to test this assumption is using independent age control. Here we suggest a new approach to this question, based on the differential bleaching rates of quartz and feldspar luminescence signals. We first present data that confirm the differences in relative bleaching rates of quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and feldspar luminescence stimulated at 50Â Â°C by infrared light (IR50) and feldspar luminescence stimulated at 290Â Â°C by infrared light after a stimulation at 50Â Â°C (pIRIR290), and use recently deposited samples to determine the likely significance of the difficult-to-bleach residual feldspar signals in non-aeolian samples. For a set of mainly Late Pleistocene non-aeolian sediments, large aliquot quartz doses are then used to predict feldspar doses (based on a knowledge of the sample dose rates). The differences between observed and predicted feldspar doses as a function of the quartz dose, combined with a conservative assumption concerning the relative feldspar and quartz residual signals after natural bleaching prior to deposition, are used to identify those samples for which the quartz is very likely to be well bleached (20 out of 24). Two of these apparently well-bleached samples are then examined using single-grain quartz dose distributions; one of these is consistent with the well-bleached hypothesis, and one indicates poor bleaching or a multi-component mixture. However, independent age control makes it clear that the large aliquot data are more likely to be correct. We conclude that a comparison of quartz and feldspar doses provides a useful independent method for identifying well-bleached quartz samples, and that it is unwise to apply statistical models to dose distributions without clear evidence for the physical origins of the distributions. },

  Abstract                 = {In order to use cosmogenic nuclides to infer erosion rates and exposure ages, it is necessary to apply a quantitative model for the accumulation of these nuclides in an eroding surface. The most straightforward model assumes that the surface continuously erodes at a constant rate. In many cases, however, the erosion is episodic: denudation is the result of the spalling off of slabs of rock in a series of discrete events. In a previous paper, we discussed two models for such episodic erosion; in one model slabs of rock spalled off periodically, while in the other slabs spalled off at stochastic time intervals. In both models we took the slabs to have a given, fixed width. In this paper we expand the previously treated models to allow for a statistical distribution of widths; this makes the models more realistic, and broadens our discussion of the fluctuations in the nuclide concentration that may be observed. We present general results for both models, results which allow for any distribution of widths. We then explore the stochastic model in more detail, applying a particular choice of width distribution. This allows us to address an interesting limiting case: when the widths are very small, the average nuclide concentration is accurately given by the standard continuous erosion model; yet, perhaps surprisingly, the fluctuations about this average can be quite significant. },

  Abstract                 = {Cosmogenic nuclides have become an important tool in geomorphology; the concentration of such nuclides in minerals in an eroding surface is directly related to the exposure time and the erosion rate. In principle, measurement of the two nuclides 10Be and 26Al allows for the determination of both the erosion rate and the exposure age. In practice, due to a variety of factors such as the similar lifetimes of the two nuclides and the limits on measurement precision, this determination is often not possible. We propose a new approach to this problem, showing how to construct a joint probability distribution for the age and erosion rate by using the concentration of one (or two) nuclides measured at the surface. We explain the Bayesian approach to this problem; the construction of the prior is a crucial element of this Bayesian method, and we devote particular attention to this issue. By analyzing previously published data, we show how this method improves on the standard approach of computing a âmodel ageâ and âmodel erosion rate.â },

For three monitoring periods, known as Area \{PADLES\} experiment series #1 to #3, of 301, 180, and 232 days in June 2008 to April 2010 over \{ISS\} Increments 17 to 22, the average absorbed dose (dose equivalent) rates of 12 positions in the \{PM\} of Kibo were 319Â Â±Â 30Â Î¼Gy/day (618Â Â±Â 102Â Î¼Sv/day), 276Â Â±Â 30Â Î¼Gy/day (608Â Â±Â 94Â Î¼Sv/day), and 293Â Â±Â 33Â Î¼Gy/day (588Â Â±Â 84Â Î¼Sv/day), respectively.

Through basic experiments using the prototype dosimeter, the feasibility of the proposed dose monitoring method has been confirmed. We confirm that increasing the stimulus laser power is effective to improve the signal to noise ratio. The lower limit of detectable dose of the prototype dosimeter probe having sensitive region with the diameter of 200Â Î¼m is preliminarily estimated to be 11Â mGy for a Co-60 gamma-rays. This value is much smaller than the typical irradiation dose (a few Gy per treatment) in the radiotherapy. We can measure the dose in a few hundred subdivisions during a treatment. We, therefore, conclude that the proposed micro-size dosimeter can be a promising candidate of in-vivo and on-line dose monitor in the radiotherapy. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are both good candidates for use as scintillation base substrates. One advantage is their relatively high density of 1.33Â gÂ cmâ3. To enhance their relative strengths and to mitigate their weaknesses, we blended \{PET\} and \{PEN\} 1:1 by weight and found that the overall characteristics are improved. The wavelength at maximum emission was 415Â nm, the refractive index was 1.61, and the light yield was 0.85 times that of PEN. These results increase the available options for base materials to be used as scintillators. },

  Abstract                 = {It is found that deformation luminescence gives us information about the microscopic yield process of X-ray irradiated KCl:Ca2+. The stress-strain curve has a macroscopic yield point. But we find that luminescence appears to start before the macroscopic yield. This means that dislocation begin to move before the macroscopic yield because deformation luminescence is attributed to radiation-induced dislocation motion. The beginning of luminescence is considered to be the microscopic yield. Investigating the dependence of microscopic yield stress on strain rate and impurity concentration gives us additional information. The activation volume obtained from the dependence of microscopic yield stress on strain rate is comparable to the value estimated from the concentration of impurity. Then the dislocation starts to move overcoming impurity-vacancy dipoles as obstacles to dislocation motion. The dislocation density starts to increase at the microscopic yield point and then sharply increases to the macroscopic yield. },

  Abstract                 = {A modified C-band technique was developed in order to analyze more accurately dicentric, tricentric, and ring chromosomes in irradiated human peripheral lymphocytes. Instead of the original method relying on treatment with barium hydroxide Ba(OH)2, C-bands were obtained using a modified form of heat treatment in formamide followed with \{DAPI\} staining. This method was tentatively applied to the analysis of dicentric chromosomes in irradiated human lymphocytes to examine its availability. The frequency of dicentric chromosome was almost the same with conventional Giemsa staining and the modified C-band technique. In the analysis using Giemsa staining, it is relatively difficult to identify the centromere on the elongated chromosomes, over-condensed chromosomes, fragment, and acentric ring. However, the modified C-band method used in this study makes it easier to identify the centromere on such chromosomes than with the use of Giemsa staining alone. Thus, the modified C-band method may give more information about the location of the centromere. Therefore, this method may be available and more useful for biological dose estimation due to the analysis of the dicentric chromosome in human lymphocytes exposed to the radiation. Furthermore, this method is simpler and faster than the original C-band protocol and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method with the centromeric \{DNA\} probe. },

  Abstract                 = {Iron abundance in cosmic rays impinging on astronauts in space habitats is of paramount importance when calculating the radiation risk for human space exploration. The concurrent high relative abundance of iron in Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and iron ability to produce damages at cellular and molecular levels, together with recent radiobiology results suggests iron as a major candidate to be studied in order to produce accurate radiation hazard assessments. Iron may be in fact responsible for a large percentage of cancer risk during a long interplanetary voyage, and therefore deserves a specific attention. We built a simple model based on \{CREME96\} for the radiation in the International Space Station (ISS) and tested it against recently performed measurements with the \{ALTEA\} and Alteino particle detectors. While we can report a good agreement between 50m and 250Â keV/Î¼m (very good for several peaks such as Si, Mg, S) we show an overestimation by this model of iron abundances of about 25â80% when compared to the measurements. New analysis on previously published work, supporting this result, are also reported. Reasons for this overestimation are discussed, they are likely to be related to the not detailed enough transport through the multiplicity of the \{ISS\} shielding and to the often used simplification of âaluminum equivalent shieldingâ. The iron sources in LEO, possibly not yet accurate enough when transported in Low Earth Orbit, can also play a role. New concurrent measurements (insideâoutside the ISS) are suggested to help resolving this issue. },

The X-ray diffraction of \{RHA\} indicates that the \{RHA\} contains mainly amorphous materials while the X-ray fluorescence analysis shows that the major percentage of it is composed of silica. The amorphous silica present in the \{RHA\} is responsible for the pozzolonic activity of the ash. The results of the present study indicate that the \{RHA\} when mixed with cement initially reduces radon diffusion coefficient, followed by enhancement when the percentage of \{RHA\} is increased above 30% by weight. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation dosimetry for industrial and medical purposes has steadily evolved over the last few decades with the introduction of several new detectors. Al2O3:C (Akselrod etÂ al., 1990) is a widely used Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) material in gamma, x-ray and beta radiation dosimetry and, more recently, it has also been tested for particle therapy (Yukihara etÂ al., 2010). One advantage of this material is the capability of acquiring both dose rate and total dose, from two different phenomena observed in the Al2O3:C crystal: radioluminescence (RL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), respectively. The possibility on having very thin Al2O3:C powder allows preparing droplets, which can be made with different volume concentrations and different sizes and can be used as basis for a 2D dosimetry system. In this article droplets were characterized using 60Co, 137Cs, 90Sr/90Y and electron and photon medical beams. },

  Abstract                 = {Natural and artificial gamma-emitting radionuclides (238U, 226Ra, 232Th, 210Pb, 40K, and 137Cs) were measured in the soils of a small catchment in the Central Pyrenees, Spain. The study was carried out in a mountainous area that was representative of the Tertiary Flysch landscapes in the Southern Pyrenees. Bulk soil cores (nÂ =Â 77) were collected at the intersections of a 200Â ÃÂ 200-m grid established in the ArnÃ¡s River Catchment. Mean radioisotope activities (Bq kgâ1) were 40 (238U), 27 (226Ra), 35 (232Th), 74 (210Pb), 48 (210Pbex), 590 (40K), and 31 (137Cs). The 210Pb and 137Cs exhibited the greatest variability, whereas 226Ra and 40K showed the least spatial variation. The relationships between basic soil properties and radionuclide activities indicate that only the radionuclides, 210Pbex and 137Cs, that are fixed to the fine fraction of the soil are directly correlated with the organic matter content, whereas the natural radionuclides are inversely correlated with the carbonate content. \{GIS\} and geospatial interpolations revealed patterns in the spatial concentrations of radionuclides and indicated important differences in their distributions showing the different behaviour of natural and fallout-derived radionuclides. The radionuclide spatial patterns were strongly correlated with physiographic features such as gradient, orientation, and vegetation cover of the slopes. Within the catchment, the least vegetated and steepest slopes had the lowest radionuclide activities, which suggest that physical processes such as erosion are primary factors in the mobilization of radionuclides in association with soil particles. The results provide insights into the main factors that have affected the spatial distribution of radionuclides in the soils of the catchment, which improves our knowledge of the behaviour of radionuclides in the environment and can lead to a better comprehension of the factors that affect their mobility within ecosystems. },

The effects of swift heavy ions on the structural, optical and surface properties of CR-39 are determined. The structural and surface properties are investigated using X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), whereas the optical studies are carried out employing UVâvis spectroscopy. UVâvis spectroscopy shows that the band gap of the polymer decreases with ion fluence. The decrease in band gap is more significant in the case of Au beam as compared to Li beam. The \{FTIR\} spectrum shows reduction in intensity of typical modes, indicating the degradation of polymer after irradiation.

Given its importance in dose-rate calculation, methods for measuring and modeling soil water content are discussed, with special focus on semi-arid environments and other situations where modern in situ values are unlikely to be representative of mean soil moisture conditions. We present an alternative method for calculating sediment water content based on grain-size characteristics using the freely available Rosetta Lite v.1.1 software. Modeled outputs include saturation, residual and other water retention curve (WRC) parameters. \{WRCs\} were generated from model outputs using the van Genuchten (1980) equation, and mean annual water state was determined using soil moisture regime maps and classifications. Dose-rate values using modeled outputs and laboratory-measured in situ and saturation water content are compared in a test case using Holocene alluvial sediments from Kanab Creek in southern Utah, USA. Best practices for how to estimate mean annual water state for different soil moisture regimes and past soil moisture content in situations where in situ values are not representative of the burial history are discussed. },

In the present work, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) positioned on either side of a lead sheet at the surface of a water equivalent phantom were used to monitor electron beam quality using the electron backscattering method. \{TLD100\} and \{TLD100H\} were evaluated as upstream detectors and TLD200, \{TLD400\} and \{TLD500\} were evaluated as downstream detectors. The evaluation assessed the test sensitivity and correlation, long and short term reproducibility, dose dependence and glow curve features. A prototype of an in-air jig suitable for use in postal \{TLD\} dose audits was also developed and an initial evaluation performed. The results indicate that the TLD100-TLD200 combination provides a sensitive and reproducible method to monitor electron beam quality. The light weight and easily fabricated in-air jig was found to produce acceptable results and has the potential to be used by radiation monitoring agencies to carry out \{TLD\} postal quality assurance audits, similar to audits presently being conducted for photon beams. },

  Abstract                 = {Backscatter factors (BSF) are used for calculation of absorbed dose in water from kilovoltage x-ray beams through the measurements using air-kerma based dosimetry protocols. The determination of backscatter factors has usually been performed using Monte Carlo calculations. The experimental measurement of \{BSFs\} requires that a dosimeter causes minimal perturbation to the x-ray fluence. In this work, we present the results of measuring \{BSFs\} using two different thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). These were LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD100) and LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD100H) for x-ray beams with energies ranging from 75 to 300Â kVp. We also calculated the \{BSFs\} for these x-ray beams using the \{EGSnrc\} Monte Carlo code and compared our results with published BSFs. With the exception of the 180Â kVp x-ray beam (HVL 0.85Â mm Cu), the \{BSFs\} measured with both materials agree to within 5% of the \{BSFs\} published in \{IPEMB\} and \{AAPM\} protocols and calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. From these results, we propose that \{BSFs\} can be readily determined using measurements with \{TLD100\} and \{TLD100H\} chips for comparison with published BSFs. },

  Abstract                 = {It has long been assumed that the initiation of radiation induced damage to biological cells is dominated by inelastic interactions occurring at the location of the \{DNA\} or within its vicinity. The subcellular distribution of such interactions therefore plays a key role in the biological effectiveness of ionising radiation, where appropriate definitions of concepts such as radiation quality, which cannot be described by macroscopic quantities like absorbed dose, demand a study of particle track structure on the nanometre scale. This has presented an ongoing challenge in the metrology of ionising radiation to either supplement or replace the concept of absorbed dose with another quantity that accounts for the particle track structure within radiosensitive biological targets. A potential means for characterising radiation quality in this way may be that of nanodosimetry, a concept based on the frequency distribution of ionisation cluster sizes induced by single ionising particles interacting in nanometric volumes. This work gives a brief overview of nanodosimetric concepts and recent developments in the field of nanodosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {Luminescence dating of individual sand-sized grains of quartz is a well-established technique in Quaternary geochronology, but the most ubiquitous mineral on the surface of the Earthâfeldsparâhas received much less attention at the single-grain level. In this study, we estimated single-grain equivalent dose values and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) ages for K-rich feldspar (KF) grains from a fluvial sample underlying Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT) deposits in north-central India, and compared these ages (corrected for anomalous fading) with those obtained from individual grains of quartz from the same sample. Both minerals have broadly similar single-grain age distributions, but both are greatly overdispersed and most grains have ages substantially younger than the expected age of the \{YTT\} deposit (â¼74Â ka). Almost half (45%) of \{KF\} grains used for age calculation have fading rates statistically consistent with zero, but the age distribution of these grains is as dispersed as that of the entire population. We obtained a similar distribution of ages calculated for 51 grains using their individually measured internal K contents, which exhibited only minor grain-to-grain variation. Given the lack of dependency of single-grain ages on the measured fading rates and internal K contents, and the overall adequacy of bleaching of grains collected from a sandbar in the modern river channel, we consider the spread in ages is most likely due to mixing, at the time of deposition and after the \{YTT\} event, of potentially well-bleached fluvially-transported sediments with older grains derived from slumping of riverbank deposits. Some spread may also be due to natural variations in the \{IRSL\} properties of individual \{KF\} grains. },

  Abstract                 = {As a first step in the monitoring of soil radon in search of harbingers of earthquakes, an investigation of suitable measurement techniques was conducted. As a result of these investigations, the following recommendations are made. Semiconductor and scintillation (ZnS) counters are the most suitable for Rn monitoring with chambers for natural drift of emanations to the detector. The method of compulsory selection of soil air is hardly effective. Soil aerosols might enter the drift chamber; these aerosols transfer many radioactive isotopes. The most suitable locations for placement of detectors of radon are cellars. Measurements should be continuous in character. The choice of a place for monitoring near mud volcanoes and faults should be determined by an Rn survey. In mud volcanoes, the best locations are areas with an average concentration of radon. For faults, identical tendencies of change in radon are maintained at some distance from the borders of the fault. For large faults, this distance is equal to half the width of the fault. For small faults, this distance increases by up to 3 times the fault width. All the recommendations were applied in the Northern Caucasus. Reliable results of the changes in soil radon were obtained during strong geophysical processes. },

However, dosimetric deviations have been found using Monte Carlo code when high density materials are present in the proton beamline. The purpose of this work was to quantify the magnitude of dose perturbation caused by metal objects. We did this by comparing measurements and Monte Carlo predictions of dose perturbations caused by the presence of small metal spheres in several clinical proton therapy beams as functions of proton beam range and drift space. Monte Carlo codes MCNPX, \{GEANT4\} and Fast Dose Calculator (FDC) were used. Generally good agreement was found between measurements and Monte Carlo predictions, with the average difference within 5% and maximum difference within 17%. The modification of multiple Coulomb scattering model in \{MCNPX\} code yielded improvement in accuracy and provided the best overall agreement with measurements. Our results confirmed that Monte Carlo codes are well suited for predicting multiple Coulomb scattering in proton therapy beams when short drift spaces are involved. },

We sought to develop a novel detector system based on fluorescent nuclear track detector (FNTD) covered with a viable cell-layer to gain spatial correlation between ion traversal and cellular damage on a Î¼m scale. We investigated the possibility to gain, in addition to track location, information on ion type and energy from a single particle track by the \{FNTD\} read-out. To access both parameters we aimed to find surrogates for the local energy transfer (LET) of the incident ion and the maximum secondary electron range in the detector material as those quantities are related to the ion type and energy. We parametrized the intensity profile of the fluorescent signal of a single ion by the maximum intensity signal and full width half maximum (FWHM). The first seems to be a suitable surrogate for the \{LET\} of the incident particle whereas the latter is only a limited measure for the maximum secondary electron range in detector material. },

There were clear correlation between the isotopic abundance ratio of 240Pu and the evaluated value \{R240\} corresponding to the ratio of fission tracks and alpha particle tracks. Thus, it would be possible to classify sample into three grades, i.e. weapon-grade, fuel-grade and reactor-grade, by setting a proper thresholds of R240. },

In October 2009 the AIC-144 isochronous cyclotron at the \{IFJ\} was dedicated to the KrakÃ³w Centre for Hadron Radiotherapy. Then, the cyclotron was modernized and adapted for proton radiotherapy of eye cancer. The aim of our work was to validate suitability of different thermoluminescent (TL) detector types for dosimetry of a mixed radiation field at the cyclotron unit. LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors are well known standards of \{TL\} dosimetry; however, several of their properties are significantly different. In this study four types of LiF-based \{TL\} detectors were used to measure spatial dose distribution of a mixed radiation field in the Cyclotron Hall during operation of the machine. A program named the MapFly was developed in order to visualize radiation levels in the Cyclotron Hall in 2D and 3D. },

The interaction energies between dislocation and defect were determined to be 0.39 and 0.87Â eV for NaCl and KCl, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {The fission-track (FT) method is a dating technique based on the observation of damage (tracks) by spontaneous fission of 238U left in a mineral. The date is calculated from the track density and the uranium concentration in the mineral. This is possible because the number of tracks is a function of uranium concentration and time since the start of track accumulation. Usually, the number of tracks is counted under an optical microscope after etching (chemical expansion of a track). However, as \{FT\} density per unit area rises, it becomes difficult to count the number of tracks. This is due to the fact that \{FTs\} overlap one another and are unable to be readily distinguished. This research examines the potential of atomic force microscope (AFM) for \{FT\} dating using zircons, which are likely to show higher \{FT\} density than other minerals due to their high U concentrations. To obtain an \{AFM\} image for a sample prepared for \{FT\} dating, removing the static electricity of the sample is essential to avoid an unexpected movement of the cantilever. A grain should be wider than about 30Â Î¼m to bring the cantilever on the mineral surface. Polishing with a fine grained compound is very important. There is not much difference in sharpness between images by \{AC\} mode (scanning with vibrating cantilever at a constant cycle) and Contact mode (scanning with the cantilever always in close contact with the surface). To confirm how tracks can be identified with the AFM, an \{AFM\} image was compared with an image obtained with the optical microscope. When change in the number of tracks and their shapes were observed through stepwise etching, the track expanded as the etching time increased. In addition, the etching rate was slower for large tracks than those for small tracks. This implied that the \{AFM\} can be used to observe etching of zircons with different degrees of nuclear fission damage. A track that could not be seen with the optical microscope due to insufficient etching could be observed by \{AFM\} methods, indicating the possibility of \{FT\} dating with high track densities using \{AFM\} after relatively short etching periods. },

  Abstract                 = {Dosimetric studies in patients submitted to diagnostic radiology examinations have been done in Brazil with the aim of contributing to a radiation protection culture. In this work, a typical chest examination condition was simulated and absorbed doses in selected organs were measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters in a Rando-Alderson anthropomorphic phantom. Doses were also calculated with PCXMCÂ® and CALDose_X Monte Carlo based softwares. In most cases, organ absorbed doses calculated by Caldose_X agreed up to 50% with values from the reliable experimental procedure based on \{TL\} dosimeters in the Rando-Alderson phantom. PCXMCÂ® calculations showed large differences in organ absorbed doses that could not be explained. Lack of agreement among doses obtained with the three adopted methodologies could be attributed to the differences between their phantoms in terms size, weight and location of organs as well as poor representation of human anatomy. If a large survey of dose assessment in patients submitted to chest X-ray examinations is intended to be done, the results of this work should be considered. },

  Abstract                 = {Pre-dose sensitization of various components of LM-OSL signal of a Nigerian annealed quartz sample has been investigated along side with that of 110Â Â°C \{TL\} peak in this work. Successive cycles of irradiations and TL/OSL readings using different heating rates were employed to attain pre-dose sensitization. The results showed that the pre-dose sensitization factor of 110Â Â°C \{TL\} peak depends strongly on the heating rate of thermal activation. The pre-dose sensitization of 110 °C \{TL\} and all components of \{RT\} LM-OSL yield \{HR\} dependence on the sensitization after TA. This dependence was ascribed to the different heating time associated with each HR. Sensitization of LM-OSL measured at 125Â Â°C generally does not show dependence on \{HR\} of TA. This was with the exception of components \{C1\} and C3. Increasing sensitization pattern with increasing \{HR\} suggests a correlation between the \{TL\} glow-peak at 110Â Â°C, the component \{C4\} of \{RT\} LM-OSL and the component \{C3\} of the LM-OSL signal at 125Â Â°C. Extension of the present investigation to diverse quartz kinds from different origins was suggested in order to study the prevalence of the pre-dose sensitization on component \{C4\} of \{RT\} LM-OSL. Finally fast heating is suggested for lower sensitization of fast component while applying \{OSL\} dating protocols. },

Nowadays the most employed kinetics is the General Order kinetics (GO). Since this model is heuristic, this article reports how successful it is in providing reliable values for the traps parameters. The equations describing the traffic of carriers were used to generate simulated phosphorescence curves for specific values of trap and recombination parameters. These simulated phosphorescence curves were later analyzed with the \{GO\} kinetics, and the resulting parameters compared to the correct ones in order to evaluate the validity of the model. },

  Abstract                 = {The \{ANDANTE\} project began in January 2012 as a spin-off of results of an earlier Euratom project, ALLEGRO, designed to address the problems of medium- and long-term risks following radiotherapy. \{ANDANTE\} will investigate the relative risk of induction of cancer from exposure to neutrons compared to photons. The project will focus on three specific cancers that may be detected as second malignant neoplasms following paediatric radiotherapy: salivary gland, thyroid gland, and breast tissue. Stem cells from each of the types of tissue will be exposed to well characterised beams of both neutrons and photons. Biological markers of possible tumorigenesis will be used to develop \{RBE\} models for neutrons. The experimental beams will be measured in terms of fluence and energy spectra in order to provide date for a track structure model, which will be developed to simulate the exact experimental conditions and to explore the relationships between exposure parameters and response. The \{RBE\} model will be utilized in the assessment of follow-up data from paediatric photon radiotherapy patients. The out-of-beam mixed photon-neutron fields generated during proton therapy will be measured in phantoms, and an analytic algorithm will be developed for reconstructing the fields distant from the treatment site using data available from clinical records. One of the aims of the project is a critical analysis of the potential power of a multi-centre cohort of paediatric patients to give confidence in the neutron risk estimates in radiotherapy patients. This paper focuses on the challenges in the \{ANDANTE\} project posed by the need to know detailed neutron, photon, and charged particle fluences and energy spectra in order to determine the neutron \{RBE\} as a function of dose and energy. },

A simple method to generate a continuous beam of those X-ray radiations is to bombarding an aluminum target with accelerated electrons using high voltage (HV). In this work, by varying the \{HV\} we study the characteristics of a photon beam generated by means of a cold cathode transmission X-ray tube. The anode is a thin (16Â Î¼m) aluminum foil supported by a copper grid. The spatial distribution of air kerma is measured using gafchromic films of HD-810 calibrated with a parallel plate free-air ionization chamber. We show that \{HV\} strongly modifies the energetic spectrum and air kerma rate as well as its uniformity and intensity in air. },

  Abstract                 = {The effect of collimation to the alpha-particle energy spectra was investigated for two different types of air filters, when the measurements were performed at ambient air pressure. Significant improvement of the energy resolution is possible if appropriate collimator is used. This is because only those alpha particles are detected entering the detector almost perpendicularly. We also show that although in-situ alpha spectrometry from air filters at ambient air pressure and with good energy resolution is possible, the accumulation of alpha-particle emitting aerosols in the surface of the collimator and the detector may deteriorate the registered spectrum. Therefore, the presence of possible spurious alpha peaks must be taken into account in continuous air monitoring. },

  Abstract                 = {During thermoluminescence (TL) measurements carried out with different heating rates, one expects the total number of emitted photons to be constant. However, for many luminescence materials one observes a decreased intensity of luminescence at elevated temperatures, due to the presence of the well-known phenomenon of thermal quenching. Recent experimental work on the dosimetric material \{YPO4\} double doped with lanthanides demonstrated the exact opposite behavior, in which the total luminescence intensity increases with the heating rate during the \{TL\} experiments. This anomalous \{TL\} behavior was recently explained by using the Mandowski model of semi-localized transitions (SLTs). In this paper it is shown that this anomalous heating rate or âanti-quenchingâ phenomenon can also be described by using a simplified \{SLT\} model of \{TL\} with approximated kinetic equations. The simulated glow curves show that as the probability of the non-radiative processes increases, the anomalous heating rate effect becomes dominant. The dependence of the anomalous heating rate effect on the values of the kinetic parameters in the model is examined by allowing random variations of the parameters in the model, within wide ranges of physically reasonable values covering several orders of magnitude. It is shown by simulation that the variable heating rate method can systematically underestimate the value of the activation energy E, while by contrast the initial rise method of analysis almost always yields the correct E value. These simulated results are discussed in relation to recent experimental work on the double doped dosimetric material YPO4. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new empirical model describing infrared (IR) stimulation phenomena in feldspars. In the model electrons from the ground state of an electron trap are raised by infrared optical stimulation to the excited state, and subsequently recombine with a nearest-neighbor hole via a tunneling process, leading to the emission of light. The model explains the experimentally observed existence of two distinct time intervals in the luminescence intensity; a rapid initial decay of the signal followed by a much slower gradual decay of the signal with time. The initial fast decay region corresponds to a fast rate of recombination processes taking place along the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) curves. The subsequent decay of the simulated \{IRSL\} signal is characterized by a much slower recombination rate, which can be described by a power-law type of equation. Several simulations of \{IRSL\} experiments are carried out by varying the parameters in the model. It is found that the shape of the \{IRSL\} signal is remarkably stable when the kinetic parameters are changed within the model; this is in agreement with several previous studies of these signals on feldspars, which showed that the shape of the \{IRSL\} curves does not change significantly under different experimental conditions. The relationship between the simulated \{IRSL\} signal and the well-known power-law dependence of relaxation processes in solids is also explored, by fitting the \{IRSL\} signal at long times with a power-law type of equation. The exponent in this power-law is found to depend very weakly on the various parameters in the model, in agreement with the results of experimental studies. The results from the model are compared with experimental \{IRSL\} curves obtained using different \{IR\} stimulating power, and good quantitative agreement is found between the simulation results and experimental data. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The shape of infrared stimulated luminescence signals (IRSL) from feldspars has been the subject of numerous studies in the field of luminescence dating. Specifically linearly modulated \{IRSL\} signals (LM-IRSL) are commonly assumed to consist of several first order components corresponding to distinct optical stimulation cross sections. This paper models the shape of LM-IRSL signals using a recently proposed kinetic model, which describes localized electronic recombination in donorâacceptor pairs of luminescent materials. Within this model, recombination is assumed to take place via the excited state of the donor, and nearest-neighbor recombinations take place within a random distribution of centers. The model has been used previously successfully to describe both thermally and optically stimulated luminescence (TL, OSL). This paper shows that it is possible to obtain approximate solutions for the distribution of donors in the ground state as a function of two variables, time and the distance between donors and acceptors. Approximate expressions are derived for several possible modes of optical and thermal stimulation, namely TL, OSL, linearly modulated \{OSL\} (LM-OSL), LM-IRSL and isothermal \{TL\} (ITL). Numerical integration of these expressions over the distance variable yields the distribution of remaining donors at any time t during these experimental situations. Examples are given for the derived distributions of donors in each experimental case, and similarities and differences are pointed out. The paper also demonstrates how LM-IRSL signals in feldspars can be analyzed using the model, and what physical information can be extracted from such experimental data. The equations developed in this paper are tested by fitting successfully a series of experimental LM-IRSL data for Na- and K-feldspar samples available in the literature. Finally, it is shown that the equations derived in this paper are a direct generalization of an equation previously derived for the case of ground state tunneling. },

  Abstract                 = {Radon and thoron concentrations in soil pores in a gas production region of the Anzoategui State, Venezuela, were determined by active and passive methods. In this region, water wells are contaminated by natural gas and gas leaks exist in the nearby river. Based on soil gas Radon data surface hydrocarbon seeps were identified. Radon and thoron concentration maps show anomalously high values near the river gas leaks decreasing in the direction of water wells where natural gas is also detected. The area where the highest concentrations of 222Rn were detected seems to indicate the surface projection of the aquifer contaminated with natural gas. The Radon/Thoron ratio revealed a micro-localized anomaly, indicating the area where the gas comes from deep layers of the subsoil. The radon map determined by the passive method showed a marked positive anomaly around abandoned gas wells. The high anomalous Radon concentration localized near the trails of ascending gas bubbles at the river indicates the zone trough where natural gases are ascending with greater ease, associated with a deep geological fault, being this the main source of methane penetration into the aquifer. It is suggested that the source of the natural gas may be due to leaks at deep sites along the structure of some of the abandoned wells located at the North-East of the studied area. },

  Abstract                 = {A new method, based on Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM), to visualize and to analyze etched tracks in \{SSNTD\} has been developed. The proposed method is based on the possibility of the digital holography to perform whole reconstruction of the recorded wave front, so that phase and intensity distribution at a plane located between the object and recording plane and along the reconstructed image of the object can be determined. In a \{DHM\} system, the back focal plane of the lens can be reconstructed so that complex amplitudes of the Fraunhofer diffraction of light distribution across the object can be known. With the knowledge and manipulation of the components of this plane is possible to design different methods of image analysis. In this paper, the \{DHM\} method was applied to determine the track parameters in CR-39 detectors, showing that most of studies carried out with Confocal Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy could be also done, with the sufficient exactitude and precision, but in a simpler and more economic way. The developed microholographic method provides a new alternative procedure that overcomes the current techniques at least in technological simplicity. },

  Abstract                 = {One of the purposes of this study is to give further constraints on the temperature range of the zircon partial annealing zone over a geological time scale using data from borehole zircon samples, which have experienced stable temperatures for â¼1Â Ma. In this way, the extrapolation problem is explicitly addressed by fitting the zircon annealing models with geological timescale data. Several empirical model formulations have been proposed to perform these calibrations and have been compared in this work. The basic form proposed for annealing models is the Arrhenius-type model. There are other annealing models, that are based on the same general formulation. These empirical model equations have been preferred due to the great number of phenomena from track formation to chemical etching that are not well understood. However, there are two other models, which try to establish a direct correlation between their parameters and the related phenomena. To compare the response of the different annealing models, thermal indexes, such as closure temperature, total annealing temperature and the partial annealing zone, have been calculated and compared with field evidence. After comparing the different models, it was concluded that the fanning curvilinear models yield the best agreement between predicted index temperatures and field evidence. },

  Abstract                 = {The effects of prior infrared stimulation on the \{TL\} emission of three feldspar minerals (albite, sanidine and orthoclase) were studied. Different reductions in the \{TL\} signal were observed in the three samples: albite (Na-rich feldspar) was only partially affected by stimulation while there was an important decrease of \{TL\} signal in sanidine and orthoclase (K-rich and intermediate KâNa feldspars). A similar behaviour was also detected when the samples were illuminated at different temperatures. Moreover, when the \{IR\} stimulation was performed at temperatures below 100Â Â°C, there was a charge transfer effect (PTTL) that progressively rose, moving from albite to sanidine to orthoclase. A dose recovery experiment was also performed, varying both preheat and measurement temperature. Our results are a further confirmation of the complexity and variability of the luminescence processes in feldspars. They also indicate that the luminescence characteristics of the albite we dealt with are particularly useful for dosimetric application. },

  Abstract                 = {The Interventional Radiology (IR) is a well established technique in medical domain aiming to obtain a good X-ray image quality while minimizing the radiation dose absorbed by patients and staff members. From a radioprotection point of view, these procedures are considered potentially harmful for interventional radiologists and medical staff. Individual monitoring of operators is very important and is performed by assessing effective dose, equivalent dose to the extremities and eye lens, with the use of passive dosimeters (e.g. TLDs) calibrated in terms of personal dose equivalent Hp (10), Hp (0.07) and Hp (3), respectively. In this work we will present a proposal for an innovative X-ray dosimeter prototype, capable of real-time measurements, packaged in a small form-factor, with wireless communication to be used for individual operators dosimetry during \{IR\} procedures. The proposed real-time dosimeter relies on \{CMOS\} Active Pixel Sensor, widely used in visible imaging applications. Some preliminary results on the characterization of \{CMOS\} active pixel sensors as diffused X-ray detectors during a typical \{IR\} session will be presented. },

In this study, a measuring system suitable for measuring high-level radioactive contamination in the narrow gap of a nuclear facility was developed. The measuring system was a fiber-optic remote system using an organic scintillator, epoxy resin and an optical fiber. The measuring system was tested for Cs-137 and Sr/Y-90 radiation sources, and could measure radioactive contamination remotely in a narrow area. },

  Abstract                 = {In proton beam therapy, dosimetric verification is important because proton beams are stopped within targets, and almost no dose proceeds beyond those targets. Patient-specific quality assurance (QA) checks the beam-delivery system using passive-scattering techniques, including portal calibrations and verification of beam-shaping devices, because there are many components to be checked, such as the range shifter, the aperture, and the compensator, in the beam-delivery system. Although the conventional measurement of dose distribution by scanning the ion chamber gives an accurate estimate of the dose, it requires considerable time and effort. While a mechanical check is useful to physically check the milling condition of the compensator, this capability is limited with respect to the investigation of the dose distribution. We investigated the usefulness of \{EBT\} films for their applications in the area of high-precision clinical \{QA\} of proton beams. Proton beams were delivered to films in a transverse (in solid water) or a longitudinal (in water) direction, with respect to the beam axis, and information about the aperture and the compensator shapes was obtained from the dose distributions measured with either film orientation. Quantitative comparisons between the treatment planning system (TPS) and the \{EBT\} film data were carried out using both distance-to-agreement and gamma index procedures. The percentage of points exceeding the acceptance criterion of the gamma index (i.e. 3%, 3Â mm) was, on average, 2.4% and 8.3% in films oriented transversely and longitudinally to the beam axis, respectively. The results of transverse irradiations of \{EBT\} films were in good agreement with those of the TPS, although consistent disagreements in longitudinal irradiation were observed near the distal edge of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), presumably due to differences in sensitivity in the linear energy transfer (LET). In addition to range, uncertainty (â¼3Â mm) caused by the non-water-equivalence of the \{EBT\} film was observed in longitudinal irradiation. The under-response of the \{EBT\} film in the high-LET region improved remarkably after we corrected the \{SOBP\} of the \{EBT\} film, using a weight function based on the Bragg peaks. Although our correction data obtained using the \{EBT\} film did not match the result of the chamber after the distal fall-off region, the \{EBT\} film could be a useful \{QA\} tool for both dose and range verification of aperture and compensator, after careful correction. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study investigated the optically stimulated luminescence of a large number of electronic components extracted from both old and new generation mobile phones and chip modules of phone cards. Most resistors and all chip modules studied present a linear dose response (RÂ &gt;Â 0.99) in the dose range investigated (200Â mGy up to 6Â Gy, respectively 10Â Gy), while capacitors, inductors and integrated circuits generally have a non-linear growth (exponential or cubic). For our experimental setup, an average specific luminescence of â¼20,000Â cts in 2Â s/Gy (nÂ =Â 10) and â¼6000Â cts in 2Â s/Gy (nÂ =Â 14) was obtained for two types of chip modules with a relatively high degree of homogeneity (relative standard deviation of 23% and 31%) and a minimum detectable dose of 7Â mGy for immediate measurement. The investigated signals show small sensitivity changes (generally &lt;10%) after repeated cycles of irradiation and readout. Preliminary fading measurements are presented. It can be concluded that most mobile phones and phone card components have a significant potential as retrospective luminescence dosimeters. },

  Abstract                 = {When applying numerical simulation to physical problems it is important to be able to clearly understand the quality that can be reached and the uncertainty associated with the modelling. In this paper we will deal with the Monte Carlo simulation of neutron coincidence and multiplicity counters. These instruments are intensively used in nuclear safeguards for the measurement and verification of the mass of fissile materials in nuclear installations. Their numerical simulation, either for detector design or for numerical calibration, is now used more and more frequently as support to inspections. Several benchmark exercises have been organised in order to assess the capabilities of Monte Carlo simulation to correctly predict realistic practical cases in neutron coincidence and multiplicity counting. Nevertheless most of them allowed reaching conclusions only on the overall uncertainties associated to the modelling through the comparison between calculated and measured integral data. In this paper we aim to analyse more deeply the sources of these uncertainties, separating the different possible causes and analysing parametrically the individual factors. We will include influencing factors deriving from the physical model of the detector, of the acquisition electronics, of the sample and from the nuclear data. The final total uncertainties are consistent with the results of the integral benchmarks. },

  Abstract                 = {Proton-recoil detectors offer the possibility to unfold fast-neutron energy spectra of various sources. However, quantifying the confidence of the unfolding methodology is a complex task. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the maximum-likelihood, expectation-maximization (MLEM) method and one-step-late (OSL) method for neutron energy spectra unfolding. The analysis is performed on Monte Carlo simulated data for several monoenergetic neutron sources and continuous-in-energy 252Cf, 241AmâBe and 241AmâLi neutron sources. The results obtained for the monoenergetic neutron spectra show that both unfolding methods provide results that are in good agreement with the reference data. Very good agreement between the unfolded and the reference data is achieved for 252Cf, 241AmâBe, and 241AmâLi neutron spectra by using the \{OSL\} method. In the paper it is demonstrated that the \{MLEM\} and \{OSL\} methods can be applied to accurately unfold the simulated pulse-height distributions for organic liquid scintillation detectors. Comparative analysis between the two unfolding methods has shown that the \{OSL\} method has superior unfolding performance than the \{MLEM\} method. },

  Abstract                 = {Proton computed tomography (pCT) is currently being developed as an imaging modality for improving the accuracy of treatment planning in proton therapy. A tracking telescope comprising eight planes of single-sided silicon strip detectors (SSDs) forms an integral part of our present pCT design. Due to the currently maximum available Si wafer size, the sensitive area of 9Â cmÂ ÃÂ 18Â cm of the pCT tracker requires each tracking plane to be composed of two individual SSDs, which creates potential reconstruction problems due to overlap or gaps of the sensitive \{SSD\} areas. Furthermore, the spacing of the tracking planes creates competing design requirements between compactness and spatial resolution. Two Monte Carlo simulations were performed to study the effect of tracking detector location on pCT image quality. It was found that a âshingledâ detector design suppressed reconstruction artefacts and, for the spatial resolution of the current detector hardware, reconstructed spatial resolution was not improved with a tracking separation of greater than 8Â cm. },

  Abstract                 = {The properties of standard lithium fluoride (LiF) thermoluminescent (TL) detectors, which are routinely used in radiation protection systems, were investigated under light stimulation. The luminescence of different types of LiF detectors, which were irradiated with gamma rays of energy up to 300Â Gy and alpha particles with a fluence up to 5*109Â cmâ2, were stimulated by a blue light and were heated up to temperature of 240Â Â°C or 400Â Â°C, depending on the type of detectors. The irradiated LiF detectors during the blue-light (460Â nm) stimulation emit green photoluminescence (PL) with a wavelength of 530Â nm. The LiF detectors showed a \{PL\} effect of much higher efficiency after they were irradiated with alpha particles than after they were irradiated with gamma rays. However, in contrast to PL, the \{TL\} readout showed a significantly lower efficiency of LiF detectors after alpha particle irradiation. These effects result from the different trap mechanisms that are responsible for \{TL\} and \{PL\} phenomena. The temperature stability of the traps responsible for the \{PL\} effect for both types of LiF detectors was studied. },

In fitting flux spectra by a sum of Maxwellians or by power laws, the slope of the differential flux is associated with the characteristic energy of the distributions and the normalization constant is proportional to the density. The goal of this work is to obtain a density-energy description of the radiation belts by using the kinetic approach. Starting from the proton spectra of the radiation belt models AP-8 \{MIN\} and AP-8 MAX, we show that the best fits are given by a power law at 1.8LÂ &lt;Â 4 while a sum of two Maxwellians give best fits at large radial distances. Assuming the correspondence between the momentum distributions and the observed spectra, we determine the variations of number density and energy with the radial distance, with the latitude and during minimum and maximum solar activity. This analysis provides information on the origin and mechanisms influencing the radiation populations. },

  Abstract                 = {The Medipix2 Collaboration, based at CERN, has developed the TimePix version of the Medipix pixel readout chip, which has the ability to provide either an \{ADC\} or \{TDC\} capability separately in each of its 256Â ÃÂ 256 pixels. When coupled to a Si detector layer, the device is an excellent candidate for application as an active dosimeter for use in Space Radiation Environments. In order to facilitate such a development, data have been taken with Heavy Ions at the \{HIMAC\} facility in Chiba, Japan. In particular, the problem of determining the resolution of such a detector system with respect to heavy ions of differing charges and energies, but with similar dE/dx values has been explored for several ions. The ultimate problem is to parse the information in the pixel âfootprintâ images from the drift of the charge-cloud produced in the detector layer. In addition, with the use of convertor materials, the detector can be used as a neutron detector, and it has been used both as a charged particle and neutron detector to evaluate the detailed properties of the radiation fields produced by hadron therapy beams. The first space flight of a Medipix-based detector is currently planned for the first quarter of 2012 onboard the \{UK\} TechDemoSat-1 satellite as part of the \{LUCID\} project. The instrument to be flown is currently planned to have 5 TimePix versions of the Medipix2 detector deployed on 5 of the 6 faces of a cube with â¼3Â cm on each side and enclosed by a 0.7Â mm thick Al cylindrical cover. The planned orbit will have an altitude of 660Â km and will be sun-synchronous with an inclination of 98Â°Current plans are for the instrument to be located on a vertical side of the satellite with one face upward, one downward, two opposed laterally and one facing in the forward direction with respect to the satelliteâs velocity vector. As such, the instrument should be exposed to the outer belt electrons during polar passes as well as the South Atlantic Anomaly and ambient Galactic Cosmic Rays in addition to albedos from the atmosphere throughout its orbit. New versions of the basic chip design are ongoing. },

The Retrospective Evaluation of Lens Injuries and Dose study organized in Argentina in 2010 found incipient opacity in 50% of \{IC\} physicians and 41% of \{IC\} technicians/nurses. These results, added to the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which lowered their former occupational equivalent dose limit for the lens, led us to assess the eye lens dose, Hp(3), during interventional procedures. To this end, a new dosemeter was designed and calibrated at the National Atomic Energy Commission of Argentina to evaluate Hp(3). Personal dose equivalent (Hp(10)), and Hp(3) were assessed for 3 months in two \{IC\} and \{IR\} departments. An Alderson phantom was used to simulate monthly exposures of five occupational staff members. Hp(3) and Hp(10) were obtained monthly for 14 occupational staff members exposed to 121 \{IR\} and \{IC\} procedures. We concluded that the annual effective dose and Hp(3) were lower than 0.3 and 10Â mSv, respectively and the average cumulative Hp(3) for working life was lower than 400 and 200Â mSv for physicians and technicians/scrub nurse, respectively. An occupational annual dose constraint of 0.3Â mSv was calculated. },

  Abstract                 = {Tuff layers are vital stratigraphic tools that allow correlations to be made between widely dispersed exposures. Despite their widespread occurrence in the central Andes, tuffs from both natural exposures and sedimentary cores extracted from the region's extensive salars (salt pans) are relatively unstudied. Here we lay the foundation for a tephrostratigraphic framework in the central Andes (14â28Â°S) by chemically and morphologically characterizing ash shards, and in some cases dating 36 Neogene distal tuffs. These tuffs occur in lacustrine and alluvial deposits from the southern Bolivian Altiplano and adjacent Atacama Desert. All tuffs are calc-akaline rhyolites, consistent with their setting in the Central Andean Volcanic Zone. Five of the older tuffs were 40Ar/39Ar dated and yield an age range of 6.63â0.75 Ma. Organic material associated with tuffs deposited into paleolake sediments, paleowetland deposits, or urine-encrusted rodent middens provide constraints on the age of several Late Pleistocene and Holocene tuffs. These tuffs provide key stratigraphic markers and ages for lake cycles and archeological sites on the Bolivian Altiplano and for assessing rates of surficial processes and archeology in both the Atacama and Altiplano. While modern climate, and consequently questions about geomorphic processes and climate change, differs in the hyperarid Atacama and the semi-arid Altiplano, the most extensive air-fall tuffs covered both regions, placing the Atacama and the Bolivian Altiplano in the same tephrostratigraphic province. For example, the Escara B tuff (â¼1.85 Ma), can be securely identified in both the Altiplano and Atacama. On the Altiplano, dates from the Escara B and E tuffs securely establish the age of the Escara Formationârepresenting the oldest expansive lake documented on the Bolivian Altiplano. By contrast, the presence of the Escara B tuff below â¼6 m of alluvial sediment at the Blanco Encalado site in the Atacama desert yields information about sedimentation rates in this hyperarid region. Indeed, most tuffs from the Atacama Desert are older than 600,000 years, even though they occur within fluvial terraces immediately adjacent to the alluvial fans that are still active. Most of these geomorphic surfaces in the Atacama also possess well-developed saline soils that, when combined with the radiometric ages of the distal tuffs, suggest slow rates of geomorphic change and exceptional landscape stability for this area during the Quaternary. In contrast, younger tuffs are more abundant in the more recent lake records of the Altiplano. The Chita tuff was deposited at â¼15,650 cal yr B.P., during the regressive phase of the region's deepest late Quaternary lake cycleâthe âTauca lake cycleââwhich spanned 18.1â14.1 cal yr B.P. Two Holocene tuffs, the Sajsi tuff and the Cruzani Cocha tuff, are widespread. The Sajsi tuff was deposited just before 1700 cal yr B.P., whereas the Cruzani Cocha tuff appears to be mid-Holocene in age and shows some chemical affinities to a Holocene tuff (202B) deposited between 4420 and 5460 cal yr B.P. in a urine-encased rodent midden in the Atacama Desert. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Aircrew members are exposed to ionizing radiation due to their work onboard aircraft. \{ICRP\} recommended the monitoring of their effective doses because they regularly exceed the limit of 1Â mSv per year for the public exposure. The effective doses are routinely calculated by computer codes that take into account flight parameters like altitude, geographic position, and solar activity. This approach was preferred against personal dosimeters method because the effective dose cannot be evaluated experimentally. However, it is generally accepted, that these calculations should be periodically verified by measurements of H*(10) which is frequently used as a surrogate for effective dose. This report refers about the database (available online http://hroch.ujf.cas.cz/â¼aircraft/) of long-term measurements with the silicon spectrometer Liulin onboard aircraft. The measurements have been performed since March 2001; so up to date, the database covers a period of 11-years (with a few interruptions) which is usually the duration of the whole solar cycle. The database comprises more than 105 individual records of energy deposition spectra, absorbed dose rates, and ambient dose equivalent rates. Each record contains also the information on all flight parameters needed for calculation of dosimetric quantities by the computer codes, and thus the database represent an useful tool for verification of the routine dosimetry of aircraft crews. },

For both cases, the shape of the \{TA\} â \{OSL\} signal indicates an initial, fast decaying part which is followed by a flat, very slowly decaying part with intensity much larger than the ordinary background noise signal. Thermal assistance characteristics indicate that for the case of pure K-feldspar, the signal originates from a unique very deep trap. The experimental features of the \{TA\} â \{OSL\} signal in the case of polymineral sample resemble much the corresponding \{TA\} â \{OSL\} features of pure quartz, in terms of both glow curve shape, especially at high stimulation temperatures, as well as signal intensity and its dependence on the stimulation temperature. Nevertheless, \{TA\} â \{OSL\} stimulation at low, ambient temperatures provide strong hints towards the contribution of K â feldspars to this signal. Proper selection of the stimulation temperature could possibly discriminate the \{TA\} â \{OSL\} signal originating from quartz and feldspars. },

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the relative luminescence response to alpha and beta radiation is very important in \{TL\} and \{OSL\} dating. In the present study the relative alpha to beta response is studied in a sedimentary quartz sample, previously fired at 900Â Â°C for 1Â h, in the dose region between 1 and 128Â Gy, for both thermoluminescence (TL) and linearly modulated optically stimulated luminescence (LM â OSL). The \{LM\} â \{OSL\} measurements were performed at room temperature and at 125Â Â°C. All \{OSL\} signals were deconvolved into their individual components. Comparison of \{OSL\} curves after alpha and beta irradiation strongly supports that quartz \{OSL\} components follow first order kinetics in both cases. In the case of TL, the relative alpha to beta response is found to be very different for each \{TL\} glow-peak, but it does not depend strongly on irradiation dose. In the case of \{LM\} â \{OSL\} measurements, it is found that the relative behaviour of the alpha to beta response is different for three distinct regions, namely the fast \{OSL\} component, the region of medium \{OSL\} component originating from the \{TL\} glow-peak at 110Â Â°C when stimulation takes place at room temperature and finally the region of slow \{OSL\} component. Following stimulation at ambient temperature, the relative alpha to beta response of all components was not observed to depend significantly on dose, with the value of ratio being 0.03 and a tendency to decrease with increasing dose. However, in the case of measurements performed at 125Â Â°C, the relative response of the fast components is much enhanced, and for the remaining components it increases with increasing dose. Special care must be taken to examine the relative alpha to beta response of the fast component at 125Â Â°C which contrasts the relative response of the \{TL\} peak at ca. 325Â Â°C. The implications for the dating of annealed quartz are also briefly discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {In the present study, the uppermost 3 cm of muddy, seabed sediment was collected from a deep-sea sediment core, drilled from a water depth of 4 km, near the deepest site of the Mediterranean Sea, outside Pylos, Greece. The core was divided into 7 layer samples, each 3â4 mm thick, in order to get an independent age assessment for each one using luminescence dating; from polymineral coarse grains in the range 30â60 Î¼m. Between 11 and 22 aliquots were measured for each sample using the optically stimulated luminescence, single-aliquot regenerative-dose analysis. The estimated mean equivalent dose values had an uncertainty less than 3% and resulted in optical ages ranging from 3.5 to approximately 5 ka, with uncertainties lying between 5.5 and 7.4%. Multiple-aliquot, thermoluminescence-based, additive-dose, total bleaching approach provided equivalent doses with typical errors of 10â15% and ages in the range of 3.6 and 9.4 ka, with uncertainties up to 17%. Single-aliquot optical ages are shown to be relatively successful, due to their consistency with \{AMS\} 14C radiocarbon ages, obtained from Planktonic foraminifera from the same core. Luminescence dates for the topmost 1.5 cm indicate a substantial mix and post burial disturbance of the surface sediment. Below the topmost 1.5 cm, both luminescent approaches indicate ages which increase smoothly with depth. The concordant \{OSL\} and \{TL\} age estimates for the sample O5, in conjunction with specific luminescence properties and its major-element geochemical chemistry content, suggest that it was heated during the Santorini volcanic eruption. Deposition rates of 8.6â18.9 cm over 10 ka below the sample O5, provided by optical ages, exhibit an excellent level of agreement with the accumulation rate of 7â18 cm over 10 ka at the sea bottom, already reported for the site under study. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves from feldspar samples have been studied extensively in luminescence dating and dosimetry applications. However, the mechanism responsible for their unusual shape and behavior in preheated samples is not well understood. This paper presents new experimental \{TL\} glow curves for four types of preheated feldspar samples; an orthoclase, a sanidine and two microclines. Both the preheat temperature and the duration of the preheat are varied, before measurement of the remnant \{TL\} glow curve. Kinetic analysis of the experimental results is carried out using a recently proposed physical kinetic model which describes localized electronic recombination in a random distribution of donor-acceptor pairs, with nearest-neighbor interaction. The experimental data are analyzed using two different methods within the model. In the first method one follows the development of the distribution of nearest neighbor distances for each of the four stages of the experiment, namely irradiation followed by heating to a temperature and holding the sample at this temperature for certain time, and finally measurement of the \{TL\} glow curve. In the second method the \{TL\} glow curves are analyzed by using a single adjustable parameter in the model, which characterizes the thermal history of the sample. Good agreement is found between the two methods. However, the second method is much simpler to use in practical situations, and in principle it can be applied for any thermally or optically pretreated feldspar sample. },

  Abstract                 = {Following a radiological incident the rapid identification of those individuals exposed to critically high radiation doses is important for initial triage and medical treatment. It has been previously demonstrated that scoring of radiation-induced foci of the phosphorylated histone Î³-H2AX, which form at the sites of \{DNA\} double-strand breaks, may be used to determine radiation exposure levels from blood samples. Although faster than the âgold standardâ dicentric assay, foci scoring is still impractical in a field situation where large numbers of people may need to be screened. To deal with such a situation, an inexpensive portable device with high throughput capacity is desirable. Here we describe a portable microfluidic fluorescence spectrometer device which passes a suspension of Î³-H2AX immunofluorescence-stained lymphocytes through a focused 488Â nm laser beam in a microfluidic chamber and records emission spectra over the range 495â725Â nm. The recorded emission spectra are spectrally unmixed into their constituent parts from which radiation exposure levels are determined. Proof of principle is demonstrated using cultured lymphoblastoid cells, exposed to X-ray doses between 0 and 8Â Gy. With the current prototype setup it takes approximately 6Â min to acquire and analyse 10,000 spectra. Further effort is required to fully develop this approach into a portable triage tool that could be used to help classify people into appropriate treatment categories based on radiation exposure levels. },

It is necessary to get a âstandardâ material containing a known amount of 10B, to correlate the number of tracks and boron concentration, i.e. to be used as a reference. Different systems were tested in order to find a suitable standard. Films made of 2% agarose in boron solutions showed a homogeneous distribution of the 10B atoms in the material structure. This system is easy handled and its physical properties are satisfactory. On the other hand, a small volume polycarbonate box was designed to contain 10B solutions of known concentration. This system showed a reduced number of background tracks and a promising behavior in many aspects. There is proportionality between track numbers per surface unit and 10B concentration, and between track numbers per surface unit and neutron fluence. Experimental results were compared to calculated values through formulas developed for thick samples autoradiography. },

  Abstract                 = {Recently, a new concept for retrospective measurements of thoron (220Rn) by CDs/DVDs has been proposed. It is based on etching and counting alpha tracks at two depths (one at 64â76Â Î¼m interval and the other atÂ &gt;Â 76Â Î¼m) beneath the disk's surface. In this report we present results of two pilot laboratory experiments that aim to test the approach. In the first experiment \{DVDs\} packed in a variety of jewel cases were exposed, while in the second bare disks were exposed. The sensitivity obtained by bare disks is much higher than that of the disks in cases. However, the response of the bare disks is affected by nearby objects that shadow the disk surface. There are individual variations by a factor of four in the response of the disks exposed in different jewel cases. We interpret this in terms of different diffusion resistance of the different jewel cases. The conclusion is that individual a posteriori calibration will be necessary to make retrospective thoron measurements by that method more precise. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The practical applications of the method for retrospective 222Rn measurements by home stored CDs/DVDs need a proper metrological assurance. The specific feature of this method, as compared to other methods for retrospective 222Rn measurements is the possibility for an individual a posteriori calibration of the used CD/DVD-detectors. This paper describes a procedure to ensure the traceability of this method to a reference \{STAR\} laboratory. A set of 7 groups of CDs/DVDs were exposed to 4 reference 222Rn exposure levels. After that they were treated in the etching laboratory as ârealâ detectors and the 222Rn concentrations were determined by applying an individual a posteriori calibration, correction for high track density and correction for depth at which the alpha tracks were etched. The results from all 7 groups of exposed detectors demonstrated relative variation from the reference values in the interval 3.4â23.4%. The results provide evidence that the routine measurements by the CD/DVD method warrant measurements with a relative uncertainty better than 25% and therefore this method is acceptable for large-scale applications. },

Therefore, this system was installed at Barajas International Airport in Madrid in 2002 for a period of 108 days in order to select an appropriate investigation level (defined as the radiation level that is selected as the trigger for further investigation). During this period 1,339,931 passengers were screened and a total of 39 alarms were triggered, 5 of which with a value 10 times the mean value of the natural background from photon radiation (which was 85Â nSv/h), and no alarms exceeded 100Â Î¼Sv/h at 1Â m distance, which is the level of response for legal transport of radioactive materials set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The potential of luminescence thermochronology is characterized by diverse luminescence signals with different thermal stabilities available for a single rock sample. These signals may be exploited together to constrain rock cooling rates. In this study, we performed numerical synthetic experiments to assess the advantages and limitations of using multiple luminescence thermochronometers (MLT) of a hypothetical single rock sample to constrain its cooling rate. A series of luminescence traps with typical depths of quartz mineral are investigated (i.e. 1.55â1.70Â eV). We use synthetic luminescence saturation ratios predicted from imposed cooling scenarios to assess the benefits of MLT-based forward modeling on constraining rock cooling rates. Our results show that the prescribed cooling rates can be constrained by applying the \{MLT\} approach to a single sample, without the requirement of a priori knowledge on the present-day temperature, which is mandatory for the approach only using a single luminescence thermochronometer. Due to the saturation effect of luminescence thermochronometers, the minimum cooling rates that can be constrained with given trap depths are also investigated for the \{MLT\} approach. },

  Abstract                 = {The recently developed post-IR \{IRSL\} \{SAR\} protocol is promising to isolate more stable \{IRSL\} signals of feldspars. However, the high temperature thermal treatments used will inevitably induce thermally transferred post-IR \{IRSL295\} (TT-post-IR IRSL295) signal, which would contribute to the measured post-IR \{IRSL295\} signal of the test dose and may lead to inaccurate sensitivity correction. In this study, the effects of TT-post-IR \{IRSL295\} signal in the post-IR \{IRSL295\} \{SAR\} protocol are investigated using medium polyminerals from a loess section at Caoxian, northwestern Loess Plateau in China. The sensitivity changes of the \{IRSL50\} and the post-IR \{IRSL295\} signals are different from natural cycle to regenerative cycles, which can be attributed to the interference of the TT-post-IR \{IRSL295\} signal. Such difference is dependent on the test dose and the post-IR \{IR\} stimulation time. The TT-post-IR \{IRSL295\} signal is also shown to affect the post-IR \{IRSL295\} Do and De values and to cause overestimation of the fading rates. Our study therefore highlights the need of serious consideration on the effects of TT-post-IR \{IRSL\} signal when the post-IR \{IRSL\} \{SAR\} protocol is employed for dating. },

  Abstract                 = {Nanodosimetry strives to link phenomenological dosimetric concepts like radiation quality and relative biological effectiveness to measurable physical quantities related to the track structure of ionising radiation. The ultimate goal of nanodosimetry is therefore to determine novel dosimetric quantities that include the initial biological or biophysical action of ionising radiation. As a step towards this, experimental and numerical techniques have been developed to characterise particle track structure based on the formation of ionisation clusters within a target volume comparable in mass per unit area to a \{DNA\} segment. Several attempts have been made to connect the nanodosimetric parameters derived from these ionisation cluster size distributions to biological radiation effects. This work gives an overview of the basic aspects of nanodosimetry, including a discussion of two nanodosimetry-based approaches used to derive estimators of biological effectiveness of ionising radiation. It also includes preliminary results from an ongoing Monte Carlo study into the limitations of using the physical properties of liquid water to approximate those of \{DNA\} in nanodosimetric modelling. The findings suggest an overestimation of radiobiological effectiveness may occur when the cross section data for liquid water are used as a substitute for those of DNA. },

The structural and chemical characterizations were employed using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) techniques respectively before and after irradiation. The morphology study carried out using Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) analysis. The \{DC\} electrical conductivity showed increases with dose and temperature and was consistent with Arrhenius behavior. The maximum conductivity of 1.1Â ÃÂ 10â5Â S/cm and minimum activation energy of 0.25Â eV were obtained at 25Â kGy, 338Â K; further increases in the dose resulted in a reduction in conductivity. The real (Îµâ²) and imaginary (Îµâ³) part of the dielectric constant suddenly decreased in a low frequency region (40â640Â Hz), subsequently independent at higher frequency. The \{AC\} conductivity showed increases with frequency and temperature for all films. The dielectric constant and \{AC\} conductivity increased at the 25Â kGy dose due to chain scission. Further increases in dose such as 50 and 75Â kGy, resulted in a decrease in dielectric constant and \{AC\} conductivity due to cross-linking. The electric modulus approach was used to calculate the dielectric relaxation time (Ï), which decreased at 25Â kGy and then increased at 50 and 75Â kGy doses. The modulus data were fitted using a non-exponential KohlrauschâWilliamsâWatts (KWW) function Ï (t), and the results indicate the existence of a non-Debye relaxation. },

We specifically assessed overall precision of dosimetric dose data in patients who received treatment with the total body irradiation (TBI). Uniformity obtained in this study was within 1.2% (1 SD). The doseâresponse was linear in the range of 0.5â10 Gy with R of 0.999. Dose rate, SSD, field size, angular and energy dependence were found to be within 3.0%. In vivo skin dosimetry for \{TBI\} was performed for 3 patients. For all patients, the glass dosimeter was exposed and measured dose recorded for one fraction in addition to conventional used \{TLD\} and MOSFET. Overall uncertainty of the glass dosimeter for in vivo dose measurement was estimated at 2.4% (68.3% confidence level). The measured doses of the glass dosimeter were well within Â±5.0% of the prescription dose at all sites expect mediastinum of one patient, for which it is within Â±5.7%. Agreement of measured doses between glass dosimeter and TLD, \{MOSFET\} was within Â±6.3% and Â±6.6%, respectively. Results show that the glass dosimeter can be used as an accurate and reproducible dosimeter for \{TBI\} treatment skin dose measurements. The glass dosimeter is a practical alternative to \{TLD\} or \{MOSFET\} as an in vivo dosimeter. },

A feasibility test of the glass dosimeter postal dose intercomparison was performed for high-energy proton beam use in radiation oncology with the collaboration of five proton therapy centers (Shizuoka Cancer Center, University of Florida Proton Center, \{MD\} Anderson Cancer Center, Loma Linda University Medical Center, and University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Material and methods The dosimetric properties of a GD-301 glass dosimeter were investigated for its potential use for postal dosimetry. Measurements were performed in a water phantom using a stair-like holder specially designed for this study. The depth-dose distribution measured with the glass dosimeter was compared to those from \{GEANT4\} Monte-Carlo simulation. The \{GEANT4\} code was also used to simulate the influence of holder material in the absorbed dose by inserting the glass dosimeter in a water phantom within the stair-like holder. We investigated the methodology of the absorbed dose determination with the glass dosimeter system establishing the calibration factor and various correction factors (non-linearity, fading, energy, holder). The participating proton therapy centers were asked to irradiate the glass dosimeter to 2Â Gy with similar setup and conditions. Results The repeatability and dose rate dependence is within 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively. Depth-dose distributions in the pristine Bragg curve and the spread-out Bragg curve were estimated to be within 3%, compared with depth-dose measured with the ionization chamber. The difference in absorbed dose between the glass dosimeter and ionization chamber was within Â±2% as a function of proton beam quality, residual ranges were between 2.1 and 9.0Â cm. The influence of the holder material in absorbed doses of the proton beams is less than 1%. In the accuracy evaluation of the glass dosimeter system established in blind test, we obtained within 2.5% agreements with the ionization chamber dosimetry for the proton beam. In this feasibility study, the results on the proton beam output check are relatively good within Â±6% for all participating centers. Conclusion We believe that the glass dosimeter system has considerable potential to be used for a postal dose audit program in proton beam. },

  Abstract                 = {Due to worldwide use of I-131 for the treatment of benign and malignant thyroid diseases, reliable dose estimation for various thyroid mass values is necessary. In this study computation of the radiation absorbed dose due to Î²- and Î³-activity of I-131 to thyroid has been carried out using the \{GEANT4\} code for water, \{ICRP\} and \{ICRU\} soft tissues simulating thyroid tissue. The results are validated by comparison with the \{MIRD\} calculations. The effect of size and shape of thyroid on absorbed dose has also been studied by varying the volume of thyroid in 10â150Â cm3 range and by using spherical and cylindrical models for thyroid. Experimental measurements have also been performed using a group of 20 patients, who were treated for thyro-toxicosis with I-131. Dose equivalent was measured with a portable ionization chamber after the administration of 405â851Â MBq of I-131. Comparison of peak energy and effective energy per transformation with the \{MIRD\} has been performed yielding only 0.5% relative differences between these two energies. For spherical model, the relative difference of peak and effective energies with the \{MIRD\} is 5.2% and 4.7% respectively and very similar for cylindrical models. Spherical model shows 0.45% increase as compared to that of cylindrical model. The use of water, \{ICRP\} or \{ICRU\} materials only implies negligible difference. Total energy deposition per decay of I-131 increases with volume for both models. The estimated results of spherical and cylindrical thyroid models show an excellent agreement with the corresponding the \{MIRD\} results. Simulated results for ambient dose equivalent rate show a good agreement with our experiment and corresponding errors remain less than 13% in the case of dose at 1Â m, and are less than 8% for doses at the neck surface. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract PVDF/nanoclay nanocomposites were prepared via melt mixing method. The intercalated dispersion of the nanoclay in \{PVDF\} matrix was confirmed by XRD. According to FTIR, \{DSC\} and \{XRD\} results, the presence of nanoclay facilitated transition from Î±-to-Î² crystalline phase. Electron beam irradiation decreased the melting point of the nanocomposites. The decrease in melting point of the nanocomposites was about 11Â Â°C at 500Â kGy. The crystallinity of nanocomposites increased at an irradiation dose of 100Â kGy and decreased at higher irradiation doses. The extent of crosslinking of the nanocomposites increased significantly with irradiation up to 300Â kGy. The nanoclay intensified the increase in yield strength with irradiation doses up to 300Â kGy. The combination of nanoclay and irradiation had a synergistic effect on the increase of yield strength. },

  Abstract                 = {\{CT\} makes up to 67% of radiation from medical sources. Therefore emphasizes is especially on the importance of reducing doses and the introduction of procedures with the lowest possible dose received by the patient. The so called low dose \{CT\} protocol was studied for some chest diagnosis however it was not investigated for the patients with lymphoproliferative diseases. Lymphoproliferative diseases, including most lymphomas involve a large number of younger and middle age patients i.e. patients in the reproductive period of life. A \{CT\} exam of these patients is indispensable method for the diagnosis, and later for long life monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy. The aim of this work was to compare the patient doses between two different \{CT\} protocols of thorax in patients with this diagnosis. The entrance surface doses were measured and compared using standard \{CT\} protocol of thorax which implies 120Â kV and 160Â mA conditions and low dose \{CT\} protocol using 120Â kV and 30Â mA conditions while maintaining image quality. The study involved 60 patients. Each patient underwent two different \{CT\} thorax protocols during regular follow up of the disease. The doses were measured using LiF:Mg,Ti (TLD-100) thermoluminescent (TL) and GD-352M radiophotoluminescent (RPL) dosimeters on the thyroid, eye lens, sternum and gonads. The results showed that low dose protocol yielded with the reduction of doses by the factor of 1.8â15 on the eye lens, 1.0â9.1 on the thyroid, 2.5â7.0 on sternum and 0.3â12.8 on gonads, respectively. The doses were significantly lower using low dose \{CT\} protocol while the image quality for lymph node presentation was satisfactory according to European criteria. Therefore the use of low dose \{CT\} protocol as a standard for patients with lymphoproliferative disorders is highly recommended. },

  Abstract                 = {Systematic measurements of swelling of CR-39 nuclear track detector (NTD) due to irradiation with fission fragments and alpha particles over a wide range of fluences from 252Cf are presented here. Precisely designed and optimized exposure and chemical etching experiments were employed to unfold the structure of radiation induced surface damage. Delays in the startup of the chemical etching of latent tracks in low radiation fluence detectors are measured and are found to contain important information about structure of the surface damage. Simple atomic scale pictures of radiation induced surface damage and its chemical etching are developed using measurements of radiation induced swelling of CR-39 detectors and nuclear track parameters. The computer code \{SRIM2010\} was utilized for the calculations of basic features of latent tracks of fission fragments and alpha particles in CR-39. Another computer code TRACK_VISION was used to compute parameters of etched tracks. Computations and experimental findings in the paper coherently compose a realistic picture of radiation damage. },

Mass and thickness of un-heated and heated polymer samples were measured. Three distinct regimes have been observed showing different degrees of changes in thickness and mass of annealed samples. The percent change of thickness was considerably higher than the mass change during heating. Thermodynamic concepts are used to explain the experimentally observed heating regimes. Role of the difference between free energies of lateral and fold surfaces in detector thickening during heating is discussed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on un-heated and heated CR-39 samples to examine the surface alterations due to heating. Results are useful for researchers who employ track detectors for radiation measurements in nuclear reactors and cosmic rays. They are also interesting for researchers in related fields, like fission track dating, which consider the thermal history of track recording materials. Our quantitative data and \{SEM\} imaging suggests that structural changes, especially surface changes in CR-39 polymer are very important and need to be explored carefully through joint \{SEM\} and the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). },

Results from the rhesus monkey â \{TBI\} study were used to establish QÎ³âH2AX dose-response calibration curves to assess acute partial-body exposures. Î³-H2AX foci were detected in plucked hairs for several days after in vivo irradiation demonstrating this assayâs utility for dose assessment in various body regions. The quantitation of Î³-H2AX may provide a robust biodosimeter for analyzing partial-body exposures to ionizing radiation in humans. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract One of the major dilemmas in feldspar luminescence dating is that the infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals are either stable and difficult to bleach when measured at elevated temperatures, or unstable and easy to bleach when measured at low temperatures. To identify a signal for sediment dating that is both stable and easy to bleach, we investigate the potential of an optically and thermally transferred \{IRSL\} (T-IRSL) signal. Based on the mechanisms described in Wang etÂ al. (2014), we develop a T-IRSL single-aliquot regenerative-dose (SAR) measurement protocol. We investigate the a-thermal stability of six different T-IRSL signals from a sample of infinite age using fading experiments, and by comparing field and laboratory saturation levels. The T-IRSL signal measured at 125Â Â°C (T-IRSL125) following a preheat of 280Â Â°C, is found to be as stable as the post-IR \{IRSL\} 290Â Â°C signal (pIRIR290). Furthermore, laboratory bleaching experiments show that the T-IRSL125 signal bleaches faster than the pIRIR290 signal, and that the corresponding residual doses are more than 40% lower. This indicates that T-IRSL signals may be superior to pIRIR methods for dating young and/or insufficiently bleached deposits. However, a \{SAR\} protocol performance test of the T-IRSL125 signal yielded a systematic underestimation of 8Â Â±Â 2%. This is possibly caused by a sensitivity change during the first preheat and requires further investigation. },

  Abstract                 = {The observation data for radon from national geochemical observation points have been collected and analyzed following the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake on 12th May, 2008 and a post-seismic effect of radon was observed. It has provided the most abundant record since the radon observation network had been set up in china. In this paper, the behaviour of the post-seismic effects of radon gas and water radon is reported. The results were obtained that observation points recording post-seismic effects of radon release were distributed mainly along the extended line of Longmenshan faults, and located on the boundary faults of regional tectonic blocks (Category II) and inside some tectonic blocks (Category II). The pattern of variation in radon emission observed was largely in the form of rising steps. A comparison was made with the variation of water level and flow observed simultaneously with radon measurement, to investigate a dynamic link with post-seismic radon with underground water conditions. This study confirmed a response of radon concentration to the seismic wave, and also raised other scientific issues, such as the dynamic association between geochemical composition of underground water and medium parameter variation of aquifers under dynamic loading, which may support the study of the mechanism of earthquake precursors of radon. },

  Abstract                 = {The application of CR-39 has been extensive for measurement of radon and progeny in air of dwellings, but limited as regards to measurements of radon in water. In this paper, a new method is introduced for efficient measurement of radon in water by registering alpha particle tracks in a CR-39 detector placed in a non-polar medium such as cyclohexane, hexane and olive oil when each mixed with water, then separated and fixed above water, as a two-phase media. The method introduced here is however different from the widely used liquid - liquid extraction technique by liquid scintillation spectrometry since it is a passive detection method (CR-39) in a non-polar liquid with enhanced absorption of radon in the liquid, it has a capability for long sample counting to decrease the minimum detection limit (MDL), it does not require sophisticated low light counting systems, and it has the potential for simultaneous measurements of large number of samples for large-scale applications. It also has a low cost and is readily available. A new Monte Carlo calculation of energy-distance travelled by alphas from radon and progeny in a medium was also investigated. The sensitivity of CR-39 detector to radon and progeny in water was determined under two conditions; in a single-phase and two-phase media. In a single-phase medium, CR-39 is directly placed either in air, water, cyclohexane, hexane or olive oil. When CR-39 is placed directly in water, its sensitivity is (2.4Â Â±Â 0.1)Â ÃÂ 10â4 (track/cm2)/(Bq.d/m3). In the two-phase media, CR-39 is placed either in cyclohexane, hexane or olive oil when each is fixed above water. The sensitivities in the two-phase media are significantly enhanced and are respectively (1.98Â Â±Â 0.10)Â ÃÂ 10â2, (2.8Â Â±Â 0.15)Â ÃÂ 10â2 and (2.86Â Â±Â 0.15)Â ÃÂ 10â2 (track/cm2)/(Bq.d/m3). The sensitivies are about 76, 82 and 110 times more than that of when CR-39 is directly placed in water. The new method is a novel alternative for radon measurements in water with a lower \{MDL\} than that of for example liquid scintillation method with a number of advantages. The results are presented and discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The dosimetric characterization of laser-accelerated electrons applied for the worldwide first systematic radiobiological inÂ vitro cell irradiation will be presented. The laser-accelerated electron beam at the JeTi laser system has been optimized, monitored and controlled in terms of dose homogeneity, stability and absolute dose delivery. A combination of different dosimetric components were used to provide both an online beam as well as dose monitoring and a precise absolute dosimetry. In detail, the electron beam was controlled and monitored by means of an ionization chamber and an in-house produced Faraday cupÂ for a defined delivery of the prescribed dose. Moreover, the precise absolute dose delivered to each cell sample was determined by an radiochromic \{EBT\} film positioned in front of the cell sample. Furthermore, the energy spectrum of the laser-accelerated electron beam was determined. As presented in a previous work of the authors, also for laser-accelerated protons a precise dosimetric characterization was performed that enabled initial radiobiological cell irradiation experiments with laser-accelerated protons. Therefore, a precise dosimetric characterization, optimization and control of laser-accelerated and therefore ultra-short pulsed, intense particle beams for both electrons and protons is possible, allowing radiobiological experiments and meeting all necessary requirements like homogeneity, stability and precise dose delivery. In order to fulfill the much higher dosimetric requirements for clinical application, several improvements concerning, i.e., particle energy and spectral shaping as well as patient safety are necessary. },

However, when preparing and performing these therapies, high activities of 90Y (&gt;1Â GBq) are to be manipulated and technicians, physicians and nurses may receive high skin exposures to the hands. If radiation protection standards are low, the exposure of staff can exceed the annual skin dose limit of 500Â mSv. Within a particular work package (WP4) of the \{ORAMED\} project, comprehensive measurements in nuclear medicine departments of several hospitals in 6 European countries were carried out.

  Abstract                 = {The measurement of very short neutron bursts, when individual neutrons cannot be counted in the usual manner, is possible with proportional detectors (such as 3He) taking the integration of the total electric charge due to many overlapped interactions, as the measure of the amount of the neutron signal. This method requires a correction related to the total amount of neutrons that interacted with the detector. This correction originates in the well-known build-up of positive electric charge too slow to be dislodged from the detection volume during the neutron burst. This causes self-shielding of the applied electric field with the ensuing reduction of the charge multiplication process in the gas, described in the literature. Short neutron bursts from a plasma focus device and a conventional isotopic neutron source were employed in the experimental phase and the known theory was applied in the analysis, which justifies assigning the observed effects to the space-charge shielding of the externally applied electric field. This work introduces a correction to the neutron yield derived from the registered electric charge, through a model of collected charge reduction as a function of total neutrons measured. },

  Abstract                 = {Concern over anomalous fading has been the biggest single factor responsible for deterring the widespread use of the infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) or thermoluminescence (TL) signal from feldspars for luminescence dating. There has therefore been great interest in the use of the recently proposed Post-IR \{IRSL\} signal, because it has been shown to significantly reduce the degree of anomalous fading observed in feldspars and therefore potentially provides a means of circumventing the issue. This study undertakes a systematic investigation into various preheat and Post-IR \{IRSL\} measurement conditions proposed in the literature, by using two samples from the Halfway House loess section in Alaska which bracket the Old Crow tephra which has been dated using fission track methods. Preheat plateau tests show a dramatic change in equivalent dose with Post-IR \{IRSL\} measurement conditions, and further tests reveal that these changes are driven by preheat temperature rather than Post-IR \{IR\} stimulation temperature. Dose recovery tests on laboratory-bleached material mimic the findings of the natural preheat plateau test data, and sensitivity change between the first and second Single Aliquot Regenerative dose (SAR) measurement cycle is found to be responsible. Comparison of the Post-IR \{IRSL\} ages with the independent age control shows that, for the samples in this study, the Post-IR \{IR\} signal stimulated at 290Â Â°C is inappropriate for dating. However, use of lower preheat (250â300Â Â°C) and Post-IR \{IR\} stimulation temperatures from 225 to 270Â Â°C gave rise to ages which were in agreement with the independent age control. },

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the basic luminescence properties of enhanced aluminum oxide doped with carbon and magnesium (Al2O3:C,Mg), including thermoluminescence (TL), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and radioluminescence (RL) to determine its potential for applications in radiation dosimetry. In general, the intensities of the TL, OSL, and \{RL\} signals of the Al2O3:C,Mg samples are comparable to those of regular carbon-doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:C). The enhanced Al2O3:C,Mg samples show the presence of Mg-induced aggregate defects, mainly F22+(2Mg) and F2+(2Mg) centers, with emissions at 520 and 750Â nm, respectively, in addition to an increased F+-center \{RL\} emission at 325Â nm when compared to Al2O3:C. In Al2O3:C,Mg with empty trapping centers, the \{RL\} intensity varies less with irradiation time than Al2O3:C, showing that the \{RL\} sensitivity of Al2O3:C,Mg is less dependent on the occupancy of the trapping states than Al2O3:C. Doping with Mg also introduces three \{TL\} peaks associated with new shallow traps. The main \{TL\} peak in Al2O3:C,Mg is narrower and shifted to a lower temperature when compared to Al2O3:C. The \{OSL\} from the Al2O3:C,Mg samples was also observed to decay faster than Al2O3:C. },

  Abstract                 = {Ideally, dosimeters should measure the dose without their dosimetric properties being affected by the radiation type being measured. Industry-wide occupational radiation workers that can be potentially exposed to neutron radiation fields are routinely monitored by thermoluminescent (TLD) dosimeters. The neutron dose measured by these devices is obtained from the interaction products of thermal (slow) neutrons and 6Li. The number of alpha particle and 3Hâ ions (tritium) released in the (n, 6Li) reaction is proportional to the dose received by the dosimeter. It is a common practice to evaluate the neutron dose indirectly from these products. In this work we present for the first time direct evidence that the neutron exposure to LiF:Mg,Cu,P (TLD-600H) can have deleterious effects on the dosimetric properties of one of the most commonly utilized dosimeters in the world. The interstitial non-negligible tritium dose contribution to the dosimeter is a result of the beta decay of the tritium nuclei interstitially present in the material. If not accounted for the effect of this self irradiation can directly affect the measured occupational dose to workers. In order to estimate the significance of these effects, tritium dose buildup was measured in the TLD-600H irradiated to different neutron doses from a reactor and a 252Cf source and then calculated in terms of a daily dose buildup rate. The effect of the self irradiation on these dosimeters resulting from tritium decay was extensively studied. The \{TLD\} dosimeters that were exposed to neutron doses show a significant dose buildup even after they have been annealed, i.e. even after the signal produced by the incident neutron dose is completely erased from the lower energy trap states of the dosimeter. The other discovered effect of neutron irradiation on TLD-600H is a significant loss in the detection sensitivity (up to 15%). },

  Abstract                 = {Results of a feasibility study for the use of the Q-band \{EPR\} measurements of fingernails are presented. Details of the first protocol developed for Q-band (34Â GHz) \{EPR\} dose measurements in fingernails and preliminary results of a dosimetry study in comparison with the commonly-used X-band (9Â GHz) are reported. It was found that 1â5Â mg sample mass was sufficient for \{EPR\} measurements in fingernails in the Q-band, which is significantly less than the 15â30Â mg needed for the X-band. This finding makes it possible to obtain sufficient fingernail sample for dose measurements, practically from every finger of any person. Another finding was that the spectral resolution of the mechanically-induced signal (MIS) and radiation-induced signal (RIS) in the Q-band was significantly better than in the X-band. The \{RIS\} and \{MIS\} in the Q-band spectrum have a more complex structure than in the X-band, which potentially offers the possibility to do dose measurements in fingernails without treatment and immediately after clipping. These findings and recent results related to fingernail dosimetry in the Q-band and its perspectives are discussed here. },

  Abstract                 = {Incineration of urban solid waste accidentally contaminated by orphan sources or radioactive material is a potential risk for environment and public health. Moreover, production and emission of radioactive fumes can cause a heavy contamination of the plant, leading to important economic detriment. In order to prevent such a hazard, in February 2004 a radiometric portal for detection of radioactive material in incoming waste has been installed at \{AMSA\} (Azienda Milanese per i Servizi Ambientali11Since the 1st January 2008 the plant is property of \{A2A\} S.p.A. ) âSilla 2â urban solid waste incineration plant of Milan. Radioactive detections performed from installation time up to December 2006 consist entirely of low-activity material contaminated from radiopharmaceuticals (mainly 131I). In this work an estimate of the dose that would have been committed to population, due to incineration of the radioactive material detected by the radiometric portal, has been evaluated. Furthermore, public health and environmental effects due to incineration of a high-activity source have been estimated. Incineration of the contaminated material detected appears to have negligible effects at all; the evaluated annual collective dose, almost entirely conferred by 131I, is indeed 0.1Â manÂ mSv. Otherwise, incineration of a 3.7Â ÃÂ 1010Â Bq (1Â Ci) source of 137Cs, assumed as reference accident, could result in a light environmental contamination involving a large area. Although the maximum total dose, owing to inhalation and submersion, committed to a single individual appears to be negligible (less than 10â8Â Sv), the environmental contamination leads to a potential important exposure due to ingestion of contaminated foods. With respect to âSilla 2â plant and to the worst meteorological conditions, the evaluated collective dose results in 0.34Â manÂ Sv. Performed analyses have confirmed that radiometric portals, which are today mainly used in foundries, represent a valid public health and environmental protection also in urban waste incineration plants. },

In order to try to date dune sands with greater expected doses, a previously published, single-aliquot, regenerative-dose protocol (SAR) for thermally-transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL) was tested. Dose recovery tests, recycling and recuperation ratios showed robust functioning and dose response curves demonstrated the potential to extend the dose range to beyond 600Â Gy. Multiple aliquot additive dose (MAAD) TT-OSL protocols were used to test for sensitivity changes in the \{SAR\} TT-OSL protocol up to doses of 1200Â Gy. A strong dose dependent deviation of the \{SAR\} TT-OSL relative to the \{MAAD\} TT-OSL dose response is observed. Comparison of the TT-OSL and \{OSL\} sensitivity data obtained from the \{MAAD\} and \{SAR\} data sets shows a lack of proportionality between TT-OSL and \{OSL\} for the \{SAR\} data which will result in a problem when \{SAR\} dose response curves are constructed using many regeneration points with doses above 300Â Gy. },

The scattered X-ray field was characterized using a spectrometric CdTe (cadmium-telluride) detector to define the radiation field impinging on the operator and thereby identify the correct dosimeter position for accurate measurement (i.e., above or under the shielding apron). In particular, knowledge of the X-ray spectrum yields information on photon flux and the energy distribution of the X-rays. Dosimetric data were then recorded in a series of 20 consecutive patients, obtaining a first set of Hp(10) data that can be used to estimate the risk for the electrophysiologist performing this procedure. },

The flow field above the detector and the resulting heat transfer to and within the crystal are obtained directly, and no empirical constants or adjustment parameters are used. It is found that the typical time lag between the crystal temperature and the jet temperature is about 5Â s, for the heating rate of 25Â K/s. The calculated temperature profile is substituted into a first-order kinetic model equation (RandallâWilkins) to obtain the glow curve, and the results are compared to experimental findings. It is shown that the location of the peaks resulting from the calculated temperature profile overlaps those of the experimental results. Thus, calibration is conducted only to match the intensity of the \{TL\} peaks. },

In particular, the applicability of Dobrovolsky's approximation is analyzed, when an unperturbed medium (characterized by the simple shear state) and the area of tectonic activity (local inhomogeneity caused by the change only of shear modulus) are linearly elastic, and perturbation, in particular, surface displacement is calculated as a difference of the solutions of two independent static problems of the theory of elasticity with the same boundary condition on the surface. Within the framework of this approximation a formula for the spatial distribution (of first component) of magnetic field variations caused by piezomagnetic effect in the case of perturbed regular medium, which is in simple shear state is derived. Cogent arguments in favor of linear dependence between the radon spatial distribution and conditional deformation are obtained. Changes in magnetic field strength and radon concentrations were measured along a tectonomagnetic profile of the total length of 11Â km in the surroundings of the âAcademician Vernadskyâ Station on the Antarctic Peninsula (W 64Â°16â², S 65Â°15â²). Results showed a positive correlation between the annual surface radon concentration and annual changes of magnetic field relative to a base point, and also the good coincidence with theoretical calculation. },

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to carry out a baseline study of the uranium-bearing region of Poli in which lies the uranium deposit of Kitongo, prior to its impending exploitation. This study required sampling soil, water and foodstuffs representative of the radioactivity exposure and food consumption patterns of the population of Poli. After sampling and radioactivity measurements were taken, our results indicated that the activities of natural series in soil and water samples are low. However, high levels of 210Po and 210Pb in foodstuffs (vegetables) were discovered and elevated activities of 40K were observed in some soil samples. All components of the total dose were assessed and lead to an average value of 5.2Â mSv/year, slightly higher than the average worldwide value of 2.4Â mSv/year. Most of this dose is attributable to the ingestion dose caused by the high levels of 210Po and 210Pb contained in vegetables, food items which constitute an important part of the diet in Northern Cameroon. Consequently, bringing uranium ore from underground to the surface might lead to an increased dose for the population of Poli through a higher deposition of 222Rn decay products on leafy vegetables. },

There are several reports showing that the efficiency exceeds unity by even more than 30%, however, many others show the efficiency close to unity or even lower. These contradictory data might be a result of the real variability of \{TLD\} properties or of not perfectly reproduced experimental conditions. In an attempt to resolve this issue, the efficiency of 16 batches of LiF:Mg,Ti (MTS) detectors for 60Â MeV protons produced at the \{IFJ\} KrakÃ³w over the last 20 years was measured. All values of the relative \{TL\} efficiency were found to exceed unity significantly, with an average of 1.09. Dispersion between different batches was very low, all data were within 4% of the mean value. In second part of experiment the dependence of the relative efficiency of LiF:Mg,Ti and LiF:Mg,Cu,P detectors on proton energy was determined. The efficiency for LiF:Mg,Ti dosimetric peaks was found to have a maximum of 1.20 at about 20Â MeV. For LiF:Mg,Cu,P the relative efficiency decreases systematically with decreasing proton energy, from 0.96 at 56Â MeV, to 0.61 at 11Â MeV. },

These fabrics were surface finished with either 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) or nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT). Under \{UV\} light irradiation the fabrics change colour to reddish (TTC) or bluish (NBT). The tinge intensity depends on the absorbed dose, which was analysed through the reflectance of light measurements. Some parameters of the samples are discussed in this work, such as dose sensitivity, quasi-linear and dynamic dose response, which allowed the samples that were potentially attractive for 2D dosimetry to be selected. The textile samples were assessed in terms of 2D measurements with the application of a computer operated scanner. The accuracy of 2D measurements was found to depend on the type and structure of fabric and tinge distribution after irradiation as well as additional polymer finishing of the textiles. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (NPP), outdoor school swimming pools at Fukushima were decontaminated to curb the redistribution of radioactivity into downstream farmlands. In the process, the radioactivity concentrations of the pool water and sediment substances (residue) were measured to estimate the deposition density of the fallout. At a pool situated 50Â km away from the NPP, the average concentrations of radiocesium (134+137Cs) for the water and residue were quantified as 170Â BqÂ Lâ1 and 3.6Â ÃÂ 105Â BqÂ kgâ1, respectively. Taking account of the radioactivity concentrations and of the water balance in and around the pool, the deposition density of radiocesium, as of August 2011, was precisely determined to be 0.32Â Â±Â 0.03Â MBqÂ mâ2 (kÂ =Â 1). The density corroborated the previous results obtained by other methods, i.e., airborne surveys, in-situ Ge surveys and soil samplings at neighboring locations. Other than radiocesium, the only gamma-emitting nuclide detected was 110mAg, with a concentration of 560Â BqÂ kgâ1 in the residue. The radioactivity concentrations of 89Sr, 90Sr, 238Pu and 239+240Pu in the water were all less than the minimum detectable activities â 2, 0.1, 0.002 and 0.002Â BqÂ Lâ1, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nanocrystalline samples of Mn-doped CaF2 were synthesized by chemical coprecipitation method. The impurity concentration was varied in the range of 0.5â4.0Â mol%. The structure of the synthesized material was confirmed using powder \{XRD\} analysis. \{TEM\} images of the nanoparticles show their size occurring mostly in the range of 35â40Â nm, with clusters of some impurity phases formed on annealing of the material at higher temperatures. Detailed studies on \{TL\} showed that the structures of glow curves depend on Mn concentrations and annealing temperatures. Optimization of the concentration and annealing temperature showed that the sample (doped with 3.0Â mol% and annealed at 673Â K) has almost a single dosimetric glow peak appearing at around 492Â K. \{EPR\} and \{PL\} spectra were further studied to understand the reasons for changes in the glow curve structures. All detailed studies on TL, \{PL\} and \{EPR\} showed that the changes in glow curve structures are caused not only by the stress connected with the difference in ionic radii of host Ca2+ and the guest impurity Mn3+/Mn2+, but are also governed by other reasons, like diffusion of atmospheric oxygen and formation of impurity aggregates, such as, MnO2, Mn3O4, etc. This is true not only for nanocrystalline CaF2:Mn but could also be so for the bulk CaF2:Mn (TLD-400) and would thus help in understanding complex glow curve structure, high fading and the loss of reusability on annealing beyond 673Â K. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (SSNTD) based diffusion chambers have been widely used for residential radon measurements due to their cost effectiveness, portability and easy-to-use feature. In India, an LR-115 track detector based twin-cup dosimeter has been in use for about a decade for indoor 222Rn and 220Rn measurements. However, the estimation of the gas concentrations using this dosimeter was based on the assumption of the same entry rate of the gases into the two cups of the dosimeter, which may not be valid for dosimeters deployed in turbulent environmental conditions. To overcome this limitation, a new pin-hole based 222Rn/220Rn discriminating measurement device has been developed. The underlying discrimination technique has been established by modelling 222Rn and 220Rn diffusion into a pin-hole chamber and validating the same by carrying out experiments in a test chamber. The device has been calibrated at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai following the standard procedures to correlate the number of tracks registered in the LR-115 detector placed in the two chambers to the 222Rn and 220Rn concentration in the environment. Salient features of the device include (i) the pin-holes act as 222Rn/220Rn discriminator and eliminate the requirement of membrane filter used in the earlier twin cup design (ii) the single entrance design for gas transmission and (iii) use of multiple pin-holes of reasonably small radius minimises effect of turbulence on 222Rn/220Rn transmission factors so that the calibration factor is independent of indoor turbulence. },

  Abstract                 = {Ultraviolet radiation (UV) has been indicated as one of the causes of discoloration of dental materials yet the \{ISO\} 4049 (2009) standard requires that dental polymers be irradiated with light from a xenon lamp, which includes UV, to evaluate their color stability. It is doubtful that dental polymers in the mouth are exposed to large energy of \{UV\} on a daily basis, but there have been no reports concerning exposure. In the present study, we used thermoluminescence (TL) from sintered CaF2:Tb,Sm, which is highly sensitive to UV, to measure the daily energy of \{UV\} exposure to the labial surface of the maxillary anterior teeth, which are regarded as receiving the maximum exposure among oral tissues. We produced disks of CaF2 co-doped with Tb4O7 and Sm2O3 (sintered CaF2:Tb,Sm) that were 5Â mm in diameter and 1Â mm thick, and placed them inside glass cases that had a 7-mm external diameter, 3-mm height, and 1-mm thickness of glass made of synthetic silica with â¥90% \{UV\} transmittance. These glass cases were fixed in dental mouthpieces in a position corresponding to the central maxillary incisors. These mouthpieces were worn by 11 subjects and \{UV\} measurements were carried out over a 24-h period in a uniform environment. The results of these \{TL\} measurements showed a \{TL\} glow peak in the region of 430Â K. This was the same as that seen with irradiation from a xenon lamp as basic illumination. The daily \{UV\} radiant energy was 72.2Â mJ/cm2 (32.7â143.8Â mJ/cm2), calculated from the relationship between \{TL\} intensity and \{UV\} radiant energy. This corresponded to 0.02% of the \{UV\} radiant energy contained in the light irradiation specified by \{ISO\} 4049. },

The influence of solvent on the scintillation efficiency is studied. The results show that the proposed material can be used as an organic scintillator but its efficiency for gamma spectroscopy is relatively low (â¼5% of \{NE213\} of similar size). },

Hand doses and dose distributions across the hands of medical staff working in nuclear medicine departments were evaluated through an extensive measurement program involving 32 hospitals in Europe and 139 monitored workers. The study included the most frequently used radionuclides, 99mTc- and 18F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic and 90Y-labelled ZevalinÂ® and \{DOTATOC\} for therapy. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations were performed in different predefined scenarios to evaluate separately the efficacy of different radiation protection measures by comparing hand dose distributions according to various parameters. The present work gives recommendations based on results obtained with both measurements and simulations. This results in nine practical recommendations regarding the positioning of the dosemeters for an appropriate skin dose monitoring and the best protection means to reduce the personnel exposure. },

BeO ceramic exhibits both radioluminescence (RL) and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and has the potential to be a near tissue equivalent alternative to Al2O3:C. A BeO fibre-coupled radioluminescence dosimeter is demonstrated and characterised for 6Â MV X-rays and superficial X-ray energies, 150Â kVp and 120Â kVp. Based on the results, we demonstrate the capability of the \{RL\} BeO \{FOD\} for accurate and reproducible dose measurements with a linear dose rate and dose response. It has also been found that the percentage depth dose curves for 6Â MV agreed with ion chamber measurements to within 2%, except in the build up region. For the 150Â kVp and 120Â kVp photon beams, the depth dose measurements agreed with ion chamber measurements to within 2.5% and 4%, respectively. },

It is evidenced that the performance of the \{CVD\} diamond detector did not significantly change even after heavy Î³-ray irradiation of 0.7Â MGy while the silicon detectors have a remarkable increase in the dark current, a detection peak shift to the low energy side, and a decrease in detection counts for 5.486-MeV Î± particles. Due to a size limitation of the \{CVD\} diamond detector, such a \{CVD\} diamond detector was combined with six commercially available silicon detectors to fabricate a survey meter which can appropriately work under severe irradiation conditions, or, at accumulated doses larger than at least 0.5Â MGy and which can cover a wide range of the dose rates from 1Â Î¼Gy/h to at least 1Â kGy/h. The prototype survey meter had a practically useful linearity in this dose rate range. Thus, we have confirmed that such a diamond-Si combined survey meter can be put into practical use. },

  Abstract                 = {The thermoluminescence (TL) characteristics of quartz are highly dependent of its thermal history. Based on the enhancement of quartz luminescence occurred after heating, some authors proposed to use quartz \{TL\} to recover thermal events that affected quartz crystals. However, little is know about the influence of the temperature of quartz crystallization on its \{TL\} characteristics. In the present study, we evaluate the \{TL\} sensitivity and doseâresponse curves of hydrothermal and metamorphic quartz with crystallization temperatures from 209Â Â±Â 15 to 633Â Â±Â 27Â Â°C determined through fluid inclusion and mineral chemistry analysis. The studied crystals present a cooling thermal history, which allow the acquiring of their natural \{TL\} without influence of heating after crystallization. The \{TL\} curves of the studied samples present two main components formed by different peaks overlapped around 110Â Â°C and 200â400Â Â°C. The \{TL\} sensitivity in the 200â400Â Â°C region increases linearly with the temperature of quartz crystallization. No relationship was observed between temperatures of quartz crystallization and saturation doses (&lt;100Â Gy). The elevated \{TL\} sensitivity of the high temperature quartz is attributed to the control exerted by the temperature of crystallization on the substitution of Si4+ by ions such as Al3+ and Ti4+, which produce defects responsible for luminescence phenomena. The linear relationship observed between \{TL\} in the 200â400Â Â°C region and crystallization temperature has potential use as a quartz geothermometer. The relative abundance of quartz in the earth crust and the easiness to measure \{TL\} are advantageous in relation to geothermometry methods based on chemistry of other minerals. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract As the lifetime of trapped charge in meta-stable states in natural crystals is a function of ambient temperature, the trapped charge concentration â measured for example by \{ESR\} or luminescence methods â should contain information on a rock's thermal history. Experiments and modelling, however, confirm that quartz \{OSL\} saturates at dose levels too low to be used for thermochronometry in mountain ranges other than tectonically very active Alpine orogens. That is why we propose red \{TL\} (RTL) of quartz as a geothermometer that saturates at doses one to two orders of magnitude higher than OSL. We compare numerical simulations of \{TL\} glow curves as would be expected at different depths below surface with \{RTL\} measurements obtained for samples from a recent drill-hole in the granitic basement of the Variscan Fichtelgebirge (Germany). Natural \{TL\} glow curves document gradual thermal erosion of the high temperature (&gt;300Â Â°C)Â TL with increasing ambient temperature. Moreover, additive \{RTL\} dose response of these samples indicates that signals are not in field saturation for ambient temperatures as low as 25Â Â°C, most probably for even lower temperatures. The sample collected near the surface showed an uncommon dose response behaviour. },

  Abstract                 = {Unlike the well-studied optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal of (macrocrystalline) quartz, not much is known about \{OSL\} from natural amorphous and microcrystalline silicon dioxide. These materials â generally termed âsilexâ â were widely used for prehistoric tool production, and thermoluminescence (TL) is routinely applied do date the firing event of heated specimens. This study presents data on basic \{OSL\} characteristics of silex such as signal composition and component-resolved thermal stability as well as the applicability of \{OSL\} for dating of burnt lithic tools. Fitting of LM-OSL curves yielded similar components (mostly five) as observed for quartz, with the photoionization cross-sections being in the same order of magnitude for both materials. Three different methods (LM-OSL pulse annealing, short-shine pulse annealing as well as the varying heating rate method) were applied to study the thermal stability of components and allowed calculating trap parameters E and s, and hence the electron retention lifetime. Only the most light-sensitive (âfast-likeâ) component proved to be of sufficient thermal stability for dating applications, as evidenced from coherent experimental results. All other components already diminished at preheating temperaturesÂ &gt;Â 200Â Â°C. Pulse annealing measurements further indicate that electron populations sampled by \{OSL\} and those responsible for the ca. 380Â Â°C TL-âdating peakâ are not identical. Dose recovery tests applying an OSL-SAR protocol with âhot bleachâ in between the regeneration cycles showed good reproducibility of a known dose if only the initial \{OSL\} signal (ca. 0â0.5Â s at 90% \{LED\} power) is used. Finally, obtained OSL-SAR and TLÂ ages based on the blue \{TL\} emission are in agreement within errors for two Middle Paleolithic archeological samples showing a âfast-likeâ component. These results verify the experimental findings of sufficient long-term stability of the initial \{OSL\} signal. Since not all silex specimens deliver a bright and stable \{OSL\} signal, optical ages of suitable samples may serve as an additional internal check for the paleodose estimate rather than substituting \{TL\} as a standard technique for dating of heated silex. },

  Abstract                 = {Nyos maar is located in the Cameroon Volcanic Line and generates a multitude of primary and secondary hazards to the local population. For risk assessment and hazard mitigation, the age of the Nyos maar eruption provides some vital information. Since previous dating efforts using a range of techniques resulted in vastly varying eruption ages, we applied thermoluminescence (TL) methods to obtain independent and direct chronological constraints for the time of maar formation. Target minerals were granitic quartz clasts contained in pyroclastic surge deposits. Thermoluminescence plateau results prove that heat and/or pressure during the phreatomagmatic eruption was sufficient to reset the inherited luminescence signal of granitic bedrock quartz. Parallel application of three TL measurement protocols to one of the two samples gave consistent equivalent doses for the quartz ultra-violet emission. Despite the robustness of our dose estimates, the assessment of the dose rate was accompanied by methodological challenges, such as estimation of the original size distribution of quartz grains in the pyroclastic deposits. Considering results from additional laboratory analyses to constrain these uncertainties, we calculate an average maximum TL age of 12.3 ± 1.5 ka for the Nyos maar eruption. Based on these new data, a more solid risk assessment can be envisaged.},

  Abstract                 = {Many natural substances have been studied in recent past to be used as radioprotectors to mitigate ionizing radiation-induced damage in mammalian systems due to its effectiveness given both pre- and post-irradiation and for long time with out drug-related toxicity. Curcumin and trans-resveratrol are both natural occurring polyphenols, obtained from the root of Curcuma longa and from grapes and other berries, respectively. These compounds have shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulant and anti-carcinogenic properties. Our aim was to evaluate the radioprotective efficacy, inÂ vitro, of curcumin and trans-resveratrol separately against radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. The study was carried out by the pre-treatment of human blood lymphocytes at concentrations from 0 to 500 Î¼g mLâ1 and from 0 to 50 Î¼g mLâ1 for curcumin and trans-resveratrol, respectively. The results showed that all concentrations tested reduced radiation-induced chromosomal damage. Maximum damage protection was observed at the concentration of 5 Î¼g mLâ1 for curcumin and 0.5 Î¼g mLâ1 for trans-resveratrol. Thus, our results show that curcumin and trans-resveratrol pre-treatment significantly protect normal lymphocytes against Î³-radiation-induced cellular damage. },

  Abstract                 = {Antiprotons have special properties which makes them possible candidates for particle beam cancer therapy. They behave nearly identical to protons in the entrance channel but deposit additional annihilation energy when they come to rest in the Bragg peak region. A significant part of this energy results in the creation of high energy pions. They exit the body mostly non-interacting and can be detected with an external detector, enabling a real-time supervision of the antiproton stopping distribution during the irradiation process. This is currently not possible in any other particle treatment method. In this contribution, the feasibility of using a silicon pixel detector in the Antiproton Cell Experiment (ACE) at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD) at \{CERN\} as well as simulations of the experiment for a more clinical environment are shown. },

  Abstract                 = {Estimation of soil-radon activity, Q was first carried out for faults in Central Mongolia. Eight study sites were located in epicentral zones of Mogod (MÂ =Â 7.8; 05 January 1967) and Avdar (MÂ =Â 3.8; 22 March 2009) earthquakes, and in the vicinity of Ulaanbaatar, where small seismic events (MÂ =Â 1.0â2.5) occurred in the past few years. Profile radon surveys were conducted at fifteen faults that differ in size and geodynamic activity, yet clearly topographically manifested as scarps or straightened segments of valleys of ephemeral streams. By applying the formalized method of processing of the survey results, it was possible to reveal radon anomalies and to establish that their shape, intensity and contrast are mainly determined by the structure of the fault zone. Due to heterogeneous permeability of fault zones, shapes and quantitative parameters of radon anomalies are variable at different faults and in individual cross-sections of one and the same fracture. Radon anomalies in Central Mongolia are diverse, yet the most frequent are the cases where (1) a radon anomaly is discontinuous in shape due to the presence of small domains with minimum values of Q; (2) a major part of the anomaly is located in one fault wall; and (3) a fault scarp is marked by a minimum value of Q. In Central Mongolia, intensities of radon anomalies, Qmax near neotectonic faults differ by more than an order of magnitude. The most intense anomaly (20,200Â Bq/m3) is registered at Hustai fault in the vicinity of Ulaanbaatar, which indicates the importance of assessment of radon hazard for the capital city of Mongolia, where almost half the population of the country reside. The contrast of radon anomaly, \{KQ\} is determined as a ratio of a maximum value of Qmax to a minimum value of Qmin outside the fault zone; it varies from 1.4 to 17.3 for faults of Central Mongolia. Faults characterized by ultra-high (KQÂ &gt;Â 10), high (10Â â¥Â KQÂ &gt;Â 5), increased (5Â â¥Â KQÂ &gt;Â 3), medium (3Â â¥Â KQÂ &gt;Â 2) and low (KQÂ â¤Â 2) radon activity are distinguished. A relative index, \{KQ\} can be effectively applied for assessment of geodynamic activity of faults in Central Mongolia. On the one hand, it correlates with sizes and seismic potential of the studied faults; on the other hand, it significantly reduces the complicating influence of regional factors, such as radioactivity of rocks, sediment thickness, meteorological conditions of measurements, etc. The application of KQ, the formalized method of detection of radon anomalies, long-distance base cross-sections, and reduction of the measurement interval near faults â these key features of the profile survey are recommendable for further more accurate estimations on the basis of the first measurements of soil-radon activity in Central Mongolia. },

These crystals were grown in argon gas atmosphere using graphite crucible and stainless steel die. Dosimetry peak was observed at 210Â Â°C for as-grown crystal. As reported earlier LiF:Mg, Cu, P is a highly sensitive material but losses its sensitivity if annealed at temperature above 240Â Â°C. In this paper, the effect of annealing temperature on thermoluminescence glow-curve structure, maximum peak temperature, peak height and integrated area of the glow peak of \{EFG\} grown samples was investigated in detail. Annealing temperature range from 220Â Â°C to 500Â Â°C was considered for the study. Experimental results of the obtained glow curve show that with increase in annealing temperature, glow peak shift towards higher temperature region with substantial increase in \{TL\} intensity. Annealing at 500Â Â°C for 10Â min gave maximum \{TL\} intensity with main dosimetry peak positioned at 233Â Â°C. Change in the defect structure with different pre-annealing temperature was analysed using trapping parameters. },

The quality of the density profile in the photopeak count approach is relatively within 155â204% better than that of the total count approach for experimental results. The same comparison for simulation results leads to a relative difference within 100â135% for the density profile. },

The use of new technology X-ray detector provides good energy resolution for detecting the elements separated with â¼150Â eV apart. Here we present the design of a complete X-ray spectrometer intended for use in the future space-born experiment. The low energy threshold of &lt;1Â keV and the energy resolution of â¼150Â eV at 5.9Â keV, as measured from the system is comparable to the standard spectrometers available off-the-shelf. We evaluated the system performance for different signal peaking time, as well as for different input count rates and show that the performance remains stable for incident count rate up to 20,000 counts per second. We have also carried out a âproof of conceptâ experiment of measuring fluorescent X-ray spectrum from various standard \{XRF\} samples from the \{USGS\} catalog irradiated by the laboratory X-ray source 241Am with 1Â mCi activity. It is shown that intensities of various characteristic X-ray lines are well correlated with the respective elemental concentrations. A specific effort has been made while designing the developed X-ray spectrometer to use electronic components which are available in space grade so that the same electronic design can be used in the upcoming planetary missions with appropriate mechanical packaging. },

  Abstract                 = {Located in Southern Italy, the Early Palaeolithic site of Isernia la Pineta has provided numerous palaeontological remains and artefacts in well-defined fluvio-lacustrine sequence. The normal magnetization of the main archaeological layer t3a and 39Ar/40Ar date of 610Â Â±Â 10 (2Ï)Â ka, obtained from the immediately overlaying geological level, put the Isernia assemblage in the first part of the Middle Pleistocene. Previous ESR/U-series analyses of Isernia fossil teeth have displayed both recent U-uptake and severe underestimation of the ESR/U-series dates in comparison with the 39Ar/40Ar age. In order to identify the cause of this age underestimation, new analyses were realized in the present study on four bovid teeth directly recovered from the archaeological surface t3a. The ESR/U-series dates obtained were once again strongly underestimated, with an error weighted mean age of 435Â Â±Â 24 (1Ï)Â ka. These too young dates could be associated to a change of the environmental Î³-dose rate during the geological history of the Isernia site, related to the revealed recent U-uptake into the palaeontological remains of the archaeological level. If we consider that this dose rate change was coeval with a wet interglacial period and taking the 39Ar/40Ar age as geochronological reference, simulations with two dose rate steps indicate that this change could be correlated with marine isotopic stage 7 (MIS 7). },

Precipitated samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) techniques. The obtained \{XRD\} patterns from the prepared nanophosphate series (Ba1-xSrxSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% exhibit an orthorhombic structure with semispherical particle shape. The lattice parameters of (Ba1-xSrxSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% solid crystals change and the cell volume decreases with the increase of x value of strontium. The thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves induced by gamma rays of (Ba1-xSrxSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% series were recorded and compared. The substitution of Ba2+ by Sr2+ cations shift the trap centers in the host of (Ba1-xSrxSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% material to the higher temperature side. The \{TL\} glow curve (GC) of sample with xÂ =Â 0.12, with grain size ranging between 13â31Â nm, reveals that it has deep trap centers, and higher \{TL\} sensitivity. The different heating rates effect of the glow peaks of samples with xÂ =Â 0, 0.12 and 1 showed that they follow the first-order kinetics. These samples have been studied and analyzed with the help of both Tstop experimental method, and the computerized glow curve deconvolution (CGCD) program. TmâTstop experiment indicates that there are three trapping levels in both (BaSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% and (SrSO4)99.8%:Eu0.2% sulfate samples at 452, 489, 543Â K and 487, 513, 530Â K respectively, while five peaks at 458, 486, 499, 544 and 556Â K in the complex \{GC\} of (Ba0.88Sr0.12SO4)99.8%:Eu0.2%.

  Abstract                 = {The establishment of a standardized growth curve is desired for optical dating as it facilitates the dating procedures. Here, we analyzed the dose responses of 16 fine silt quartz samples from the Lower Mississippi Valley in order to identify common properties that would allow establishing a standardized \{OSL\} growth curve (SGC). The analysis confirms the dependence of the standardized dose response upon the size of test dose. This dependence was corrected by converting the standardized dose response to an equivalent standardized dose response obtained by a 1.8Â Gy test dose. Equivalent \{SGCs\} were established for two different grain size ranges by combining the data of several samples and fitting the sum of a single saturating exponential function and a linear function to the equivalent standardized dose response of these data. Equivalent doses up to 500Â Gy determined with an equivalent \{SGC\} agree well with those obtained with a conventional \{SAR\} protocol, suggesting that the equivalent \{SGCs\} established in this study are reliable. },

The concentration of radioactivity in contaminated vegetables was higher than the value of the legal limit for shipment, therefore, we attempted to identify a simple and effective removal method for contaminated farm products to ensure the relief of farmers and the security of consumers. First, the radioactivity distribution and adhesion state of contaminated vegetables were investigated by an imaging plate (IP) image. As a result, there were two types of contamination, spot type or spread type, of vegetables. The removal of radioactivity by physical or chemical methods was investigated. As a result, radioactivity removal by water washing showed no significant difference between boiling water and cold water. There was no significant difference between hand washing and running water washing. The result of chemical removal showed that reducing agents removed radioactivity from vegetables by 70â80% for 131I and more than 80% for 137Cs. In particular, ascorbic acid is promising as a safe and versatile option. },

  Abstract                 = {Personal neutron dosimeters are necessary for radiation protection of nuclear workers in high energy accelerator facilities. To improve sensitivity for high energy neutrons above 10Â MeV, a new personal neutron dosimeter was designed using a solid state nuclear track detector (CR-39) covered with Multi-Layer radiator consisting of polyethylene, polyamide and iron/aluminum sheets. In this work, we investigated various radiator combinations and thicknesses in order to detect high energy neutrons above 10Â MeV. Energy response of each radiator was calculated using the multi-purpose Monte Carlo simulation code, Particle and Heavy Ion Transport System (PHITS). To evaluate the accuracy of our calculations, the energy response of each radiator was measured in a mono-energetic neutron field at the Facility of Radiation Standard (FRS) of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA). The energy response of each radiator calculated by \{PHITS\} was in good agreement with our experimental results. The results obtained in this research indicate that \{PHITS\} is a useful software tool for the design of new personal neutron dosimeters using CR-39 and using Multi-layer radiator approach. },

  Abstract                 = {We have designed and fabricated a 16-channel Waveform Sampling \{ASIC\} for radiation detection and measurement. Waveform sampling is very important for the pulse shape analysis and discrimination, which is often used in radiation detection to discriminate different radiations such as alpha, beta and gamma rays. One channel of the fabricated \{ASIC\} consists of a charge-sensitive preamplifier, a \{VGA\} (Variable Gain Amplifier), an \{ADC\} (Analog to Digital Converter) and digital circuits. The preamplifier converts the current signal to the voltage signal, and the \{VGA\} amplifies the signal to appropriate level for the ADC. The \{ADC\} was designed to digitize the waveform with a frequency of 100Â MHz and a resolution of 6bits. Digital circuits consist of a free-running \{ADC\} and a multiplexer which were designed to convert a digitized 100Â MHz/6bit signal to a 200Â MHz/3bit one, which is effective for the reduction of the number and for the achievement of the high integration in one chip. This chip was designed and fabricated with 0.35Â Î¼m \{CMOS\} technology by \{ROHM\} and the size of the \{ASIC\} is 4.9Â mm by 4.9Â mm. The design concept and some experimental results are shown in this paper. },

When Dy activated Sr6AlP5O20 phosphor excited by 350Â nm, the phosphors show an efficient blue and yellow band emission, which originates from the 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H15/2 and 4F9/2Â âÂ 6H13/2 transitions of Dy3+ ion.

Li3B7O12:Cu has a single glow peak at 120Â Â°C at a heating rate of 0.317Â Â°CÂ sâ1. The dose response is linear between 0.1 and 10Â Gy. The phosphor, when combined with a synthetic resin, can be molded into 200Â mmÂ ÃÂ 200Â mmÂ ÃÂ 2.5Â mm slabs. The system has a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) dependent spatial resolution (pixel pitch) of 640Â Î¼m and a pixel response standard deviation of 1.33%. Using simple pixel-based noise compensation, we were able to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the final image. In tests as a TEP, this system gives off axis ratio and percentage dose depth results highly correlated with those of an ion chamber suspended in a water phantom. The TEP-TLSD/SR1 produces similar images to Gafchromic film for X-ray imaging. This TEP-TLSD/SR1 is not only larger than the prototype, but also has a better \{SNR\} and improved usability. With further improvements in tissue equivalence, we foresee a system where a \{TEP\} and dosimeter are combined into a three-dimensional dosimeter. },

The exposed slabs were individually heated and the thermoluminescence was captured using a digital camera and subsequently analyzed. The dose response of the TEP-TLD was found to be highly linear in the range of 500Â mGy Ë50Â Gy and the off axis ratio showed close correlation to that of ion chamber. By controlling the time and temperature between irradiation and measurements the response was shown to have a high repeatability, with standard deviation of 2%. },

  Abstract                 = {A fast response radiation detector (survey meter) based on a response prediction method was developed and implemented to determine contamination levels and to decontaminate areas contaminated by cesium-137 (137Cs ) released during the nuclear reactor accident. Traditionally, 30Â s is required to measure the count rate (1/min), which is a criterion for the level of contamination, when the time constant of the equipment is 10Â s. A detector with faster response would eliminate the excessive time necessary to inspect for contamination. A previously proposed response prediction method was applied to overcome this problem; however, increase in errors is possible at short measurement times. The effect was determined through an experiment. Relative error (standard deviation/count rate) for a static response was approximately 0.5% in the vicinity of the maximum value. The predicted value suggests that predictions close to real time (requiring 0.1Â s) are possible. However, the relative error for the almost maximum value was about 4.3%. The relative error for a three-point moving average of the predicted values (requiring 0.3Â s) was about 3.8%, and the relative error for a five-point moving average of the predicted values (requiring 0.5Â s) was about 3.1%. The experiment shows that while the response prediction method has larger relative error than the static response, the prediction will take less than 1Â s,Â enabling significantly faster processing. },

  Abstract                 = {Luminescence of color centers in the near-infrared region under cathode beam excitation is revealed for the first time in as-grown pure LiF and LiF:Mg,O crystals. Emission efficiency of F 2 + , F 3 â and F 2 â centers is higher for the samples enriched by oxygen and magnesium than for ultrapure crystals. The intensity of the \{NIR\} luminescence remains practically constant with the increase of the electron beam density. In contrast, visible emission typical for F 3 + and \{F2\} centers is suppressed due to the induced absorption bands. It is assumed that the high-density electronic irradiation leads to the strongly pronounced thermal- and radiation-stimulated diffusion in a relatively thin layer. It causes the association of point radiation defects with the formation of various complex centers and aggregates. Results obtained suggest that LiF crystals can be used for in-situ detection of ionizing radiation. },

Most of the conventional measurement techniques require a special chemical treatment or an enrichment process. Thin-layer Î±-Al2O3:C passive luminescence beta detectors have been successfully used for measuring dose rates due to beta decay of 90Sr inside small samples. In this paper, a new refinement is introduced for the assessment of 90Sr concentration in dental tissue using thin-layer Î±-Al2O3:C passive luminescence beta detectors. The performance parameters of passive luminescence beta detection (such as detection and quantification limits) have been evaluated using statistical analysis of the experimental results. The sources of uncertainty have been analyzed and the total uncertainty calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. The results of \{TL\} passive beta detection for measurement of 90Sr concentrations are shown to be in good agreement with those obtained using low-level beta counting. },

  Abstract                 = {During the long-term study of tooth enamel by \{EPR\} dosimetry for population exposed to radiation due to contamination of the Techa River, it was found out that for some of the tooth donors the dose accumulated in tooth enamel could be as high as several tens of Gy. Such doses were absorbed only in tooth enamel and they should not be associated with exposures to other organs or the whole body. The nature of such doses was discussed in a number of previous papers where it was shown that the source of such doses is 90Sr incorporated in the calcified dental tissues. However, among specialists in radiation dosimetry who were not involved in the biokinetic studies, the nature and dosimetric significance of extra-high doses in tooth enamel are still raising questions. The aim of the current paper is to summarize the accumulated information on extra-high doses in the teeth of the Techa riverside residents, describe the dose levels observed, explain the nature of extra-high doses in the enamel and discuss their informative value. The paper includes an overview of already published findings and an analysis of information collected in the data bank of the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (URCRM), Chelyabinsk, Russia, which has not been published before. },

The variability of \{OSL\} sensitivity, from individual to individual using multiple-teeth samples, was determined to be 53%. X-ray and beta exposure were found to produce \{OSL\} curves with the same shape that differed from those due to ultraviolet (UV) exposure; as a result, correlation was observed between \{OSL\} signals after X-ray and beta exposure and was absent if compared to \{OSL\} signals after \{UV\} exposure. Fading of the \{OSL\} signal was âtypicalâ for most teeth with just a few of incisors showing atypical behavior. Typical fading dependences were described by a bi-exponential decay function with âfastâ (decay time around of 12Â min) and âslowâ (decay time about 14Â h) components. \{OSL\} detection limits, based on the techniques developed to-date, were found to be satisfactory from the point of view of medical triage requirements if conducted within 24Â h of the exposure. },

Materials investigated included human nails, business cards and plastic buttons. The \{OSL\} properties of these materials were studied in comparison with those of teeth. Most samples revealed \{OSL\} signals only after exposure to ionizing radiation; some samples of business cards, however, displayed a strong initial ânativeâ signal (i.e. existing in the samples prior to irradiation). The sensitivity (minimum measurable dose) of the samples was found to vary significantly from sample to sample of the same material and was in the range from several tens of mGy to a few dozens of Gy. The dose-response curves were linear for doses below 10Â Gy. Fading of the \{OSL\} signals was estimated for different lenghts of times and found to be â¼95%, 45%, 30% and 15% for samples of teeth, business cards, buttons and nails, respectively, following storage at room temperature in the dark for a period of 3 weeks after exposure. For samples stored under routine laboratory light, fading was much faster and the radiation-induced signals almost disappeared after a few hours of such illumination. It was concluded that the tested materials could be used in triage situations to detect and estimate the possible overexposure of individuals if the measurements can be performed soon enough after exposure. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Several commonplace materials were studied as possible emergency optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters. The materials included: paper currency (banknotes) and coins of different denomination and from different countries; plastic cards of different types (credit and debit cards, driver's license cards, membership cards, etc.), parts and details of clothing and shoes as well as samples of different fabrics. The samples displayed significant variability in their \{OSL\} properties. They differed in the intensity of the initial ânativeâ signal; the bleaching time of the \{OSL\} signal; the sensitivity to light of different wavelengths; the fading rate of \{OSL\} signals, etc. Procedures of \{OSL\} analysis were proposed to account for this variety. Values of the minimum measurable dose (MMD) were below 2Â Gy for most tested samples if \{OSL\} measurements were conducted within one week of exposure and the samples were kept in dark since exposure (except samples of shoes that were kept under environmental light). The \{OSL\} signals in banknotes appear to originate from compounds containing aluminum, silicon, calcium and titanium â these elements were detected using X-ray microanalysis. For coins, the source of the \{OSL\} signals is speculated to be small particles of quartz, which were detected on the coins' surfaces. The X-ray microanalysis spectra from fabrics and shoes revealed sodium, aluminum, titanium, iron and nickel as elements that appeared to be responsible for the radiation sensitivity of those samples. It was concluded that, under certain constrained circumstances, paper and metallic money, personal plastic cards, clothing and shoes could be used as emergency \{OSL\} dosimeters in triage applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Conversion to absolute dose in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of \{MV\} radiotherapy beams needs correct modeling of backscatter (BS) to the linear accelerator (linac) monitor chamber. For some linacs the \{BS\} depends largely on jaw settings. The backscattered fraction (BSF) of radiation can be determined experimentally by measuring ratios of target charge for a given number of monitor units as a function of jaw settings. This was done using the in-house developed \{ME40\} dosimetry system, which is able to determine the target charge for each radiation pulse from the linac. The \{BSF\} measurements were performed for different linac models at five Danish radiotherapy clinics. The investigated linacs were four Varian TrueBeams (TB), one Varian iX (iX) and one Elekta Synergy (ES). \{BSF\} measurements were performed for square field side lengths ranging from 1 to 40Â cm, using the 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2 field as reference. The impact of the flattening filter on the \{BSF\} was investigated through measurements in flattened as well as flattening filter free (FFF) beams. Furthermore, to investigate the contribution from the upper and lower jaws separately, measurements at one of the clinics also included asymmetric fields. For the iX, the obtained \{BSF\} measurements were compared with \{MC\} simulations performed using the \{BEAMnrc\} user code. For flattened beams on the Varian linacs, the measured \{BSF\} exhibited a clear linear correlation with square jaw settings (correlation coefficient rÂ &gt;Â 0.9 with pÂ &lt;Â 0.001 in all cases). For the ES, however, no correlation between \{BSF\} and jaw settings was found (rÂ =Â 0.04, pÂ =Â 0.92). The change in \{BSF\} with jaw settings was also found to be negligible for \{FFF\} beams on the \{TB\} linacs, indicating that the flattening filter has a substantial influence on the BSF. Furthermore, the backscatter effect was found to be more pronounced (up to a factor of 7) for the iX compared to the TB. \{MC\} simulations on the iX agreed within 0.4% with \{BSF\} measurements, indicating that the target charge measurement method used for determination of \{BSF\} is accurate. Furthermore, the similar \{BSF\} observed for the four \{TB\} linacs included in the study also indicates that the method used for target charge measurements is reproducible. The reproducibility lies mainly in the fact that the method basically has no set-up errors and therefore is user independent. },

The results were compared with calculations with the fragment emission angle model (FRANG). The angular resolution of the measurements was achieved to be &lt;0.1Â°. The measured fragment emission angles imply that the generally accepted straight-ahead approximation of fragment emissions in nuclear collisions is oversimplified as the fragments are clearly emitted at different angles related to the primary particles. The calculated values were in agreement with the experimental ones within the margin of a few degrees for most of the examined projectile-target systems. However, some discrepancies were observed. Thus a new calculation was performed with a modified version of the model M-FRANG. For both \{FRANG\} and M-FRANG, chai-square values were calculated to test the degree of agreement with our measurements. It was confirmed that the M-FRANG showed better agreement despite its simplicity, and it was established it can be successfully used in several applications, including simple and fast test of more complicated 3D particle and heavy ion transport codes. },

  Abstract                 = {At ambient temperatures, a permanent change due to neutron irradiation has been identified in the luminescent properties of the common mineral calcite. Calcite is one of many ubiquitous minerals that are known to exhibit luminescence under electron bombardment, a process known as cathodoluminescence (CL). The UVâVisible spectra of individual calcite grains were measured with \{CL\} spectroscopy before and after neutron irradiation. Exposure to neutrons causes additional crystal lattice defects (beyond those naturally-occurring) that leave a permanent, readily-measurable \{CL\} signature in the 515Â nm region of the spectrum. Dose response results following irradiation have been measured and a spectroscopic signature is described that increases proportionately to neutron dose. The \{CL\} measurements are complicated by a dependence on the orientation relative to direction of excitation. When taken into account, the total dose to the crystal can be estimated, and possibly even the direction of the neutron source can be determined. This signature could potentially be developed into a nuclear forensics tool to help identify locations where special nuclear materials have been stored. },

The recent revision of this legislation aims to update it in the light of the latest knowledge and experience and to simplify it by consolidating the current legal acts into one Directive. The draft of the revised Euratom \{BSS\} Directive has been approved by the group of scientific experts under Euratom Treaty Article 31 and is currently undergoing the European Commissionâs procedures. This draft contains several new or amended provisions relating to protection of medical staff, among them: (i) a streamlining of the annual dose limit provisions, (ii) enhancing the use of dose constraints in optimization of protection, and (iii) ensuring better recording and transfer of occupational dose data including in cases of trans-border movement of workers. The Community action to radiation protection of workers is not restricted to passing relevant legislation but also includes âsoft actionâ as issuing guidance, supporting research and stakeholdersâ involvement, etc. In August 2010 the Commission issued a Communication to the Council and the European Parliament dealing with the issues in the medical uses of ionizing radiation, including those relating to radiation protection of medical staff. },

At 830 nm the fast and medium photoionization cross-sections were found to be sufficiently different that infrared bleaching at raised temperatures allowed the selective removal of the fast component with negligible depletion of the medium. A method for optically separating the \{OSL\} components of quartz is suggested, based on the wavelength dependence of photoionization cross-sections. },

The simulated curve resembles a first order kinetics curve when Î±Â =Â no/(100N) and a second order kinetics curve when Î±Â =Â 0.999. However, comparison with general order kinetics for the intermediate range is not possible as a one- to-one correspondence between Î± and b cannot be made.

The formation of the single phase compound was confirmed by Powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis. Variation of the doping level has shown that the impurity (Eu3+) concentration for maximum \{TL\} sensitivity is 0.5Â mol%. Heat treatments given to achieve the high \{TL\} sensitivity of this phosphor also showed that it needs to be annealed at 973Â K for 1Â h. Incorporation of the impurity in the Eu+3 states was confirmed by the \{PL\} emission peaks. The \{TL\} glow curve consists of a prominent dosimetry peak at around 458Â K besides small shoulders on both sides at around 400 and 500Â K. The dose response of the phosphor was found to be sub-linear up to 10Â Gy of the dose and later it becomes linear till it start saturating beyond 1Â kGy. The \{TL\} sensitivity of the newly developed NaLi2PO4:Eu3+ phosphor to Î³ radiation from 137Cs (in the linear dose range) was compared to some standard commercially available phosphors, such as, TLD-100, TLD-400, TLD-700H and TLD-900. It was found to be much more sensitive than these phosphors except TLD-700H, which is â¼2 times more sensitive. Easy method of synthesis, simple glow curve structure, high sensitivity, low fading, wide range of doses and very good reusability make the phosphor a suitable candidate for the \{TL\} dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of apoptosis progression has been studied in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) irradiated with selected doses (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10Â Gy) of 60Co Î³ rays and subsequently cultivated for 16Â h inÂ vitro. A dose-dependent increase and decrease of shrunk and intact cells, respectively, has been observed in the range of 0.5â4Â Gy while higher doses have not affected the relative numbers of intact and apoptotic cells. The relative number of early apoptotic cells did not change within the dose range studied. Immunophenotyping of intact and very early apoptotic cells have indicated that the remaining intact cells represent the most convenient population for radioresistance studies inÂ vitro. The CD21+CD27+ subset of peripheral B-cells has thus been suggested as a putative biodosimetric marker inÂ vitro. },

  Abstract                 = {After over 25 years, the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) is well-established in dating sites of geological, paleontological and archaeological interest. Like any scientific technique, there have been changes in understanding and in methodology. Improvements have not, however, changed the observation that external dose calculations are still a significant source of uncertainty in ages. Examples from Europe, Africa and the Americans illustrate this point. For Pradayrol Cave (France), the occupation age, 330Â ka, is unchallenged, making this the oldest known Neanderthal site in France. For Roc de Marsal, also in France, on the other hand, discrepancies between \{TL\} and sedimentary dose rates imply substantial differences in interpretation. In the Western Egyptian Desert, where artifacts and datable material are not well-correlated, the dating results show consistency with expectations based on global climate change, even in deflated sites. Climate change is also the question in geological studies in the Bahamas where, despite concerns about cosmic dose history, \{ESR\} dates confirm other evidence for sea level changes. We show that an uncertain age is not the same as an impossible one. },

No direct relationship was found between the thermal stability of the infrared-stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal and measured K-content of individual grains. However, the brightest \{IRSL\} and post-IR \{IRSL\} signals originated from grains with â¼12% K-content. All grains giving a measurable signal had K-content between 6 and 13%, therefore it is suggested that an internal K-content of 10Â Â±Â 2% can be assumed for routine single-grain dating of density-separated K-feldspars. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Post-IR \{IRSL\} (pIRIR) signals from K-feldspar grains measured at elevated temperatures are increasingly being used for dating sediments. Unfortunately the pIRIR signal from K-feldspars bleaches more slowly than other signals (e.g. \{OSL\} from quartz) upon exposure to daylight, leading to concerns about residual signals remaining at deposition. However, earlier studies have not assessed whether the pIRIR signal bleaches at the same rate in all feldspar grains. In this study laboratory bleaching experiments have been conducted and for the first time the results show that the rate at which the pIRIR signal from individual K-feldspar grains bleach varies. To determine whether grain-to-grain variability in bleaching rate has a dominant control on equivalent dose (De) distributions determined using single grains, analysis was undertaken on three samples with independent age control from different depositional environments (two aeolian and one glaciofluvial). The De value determined from each grain was compared with the rate at which the pIRIR225 signal from the grain bleaches. The bleaching rate of each grain was assessed by giving a 52Â Gy dose and measuring the residual De after bleaching for an hour in a solar simulator. There is no clear relationship between the rate at which the pIRIR225 signal of an individual grain bleaches and the magnitude of its De. It is concluded that variability in the bleaching rate of the pIRIR225 signal from one grain to another does not appear to be a dominant control on single grain De distributions. },

  Abstract                 = {The working principle of the Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is the selective delivery of a greater amount of boron to the tumor cells than to the healthy ones, followed by the neutron irradiation that will induce the emission of Î±-particles and recoil 7Li nuclei through the 10B(n,Î±)7Li reaction. The objective of this work is to present a setup composed of a boron thin film coupled with CR-39. Alpha and 7Li particle coming from the boron films are used to quantify neutron boron reaction and are detected by CR-39. The nuclei compounding of this detector, H, C and O, will undergo fast neutrons reactions, which will be detected in the CR-39 itself. In this way, the 10B(n,Î±)7Li reaction and the contribution of fast neutrons to the flux can be determined at the same time. These measurements are essential for treatment planning as well as for studies of the biodistribution of 10B-carrier drugs and tissue microdosimetry. The boron films were deposited on stainless steel substrates through the sputtering technique and irradiated with thermal neutrons at the reactor IEA-R1 located at IPEN, SÃ£o Paulo/SP, Brazil. Here we show the first results on the characterization of these thin films and calibration of the proposed setup. },

  Abstract                 = {Determination of annual lamination provides important additional constraints to radiometric dates on speleothems, both for dating the duration of specific growth intervals and optimizing growth models. In the absence of visible laminae, however, speleothem age models are reliant upon curve fitting through discretely dated points and are therefore inherently more uncertain than annual chronologies from laminae. Given that the impact of seasonality on speleothems is expected to be strong enough to generate an annual pulse in trace element chemistry regardless of whether or not visible or fluorescent growth laminae are visible, we demonstrate the potential for deriving high-resolution stalagmite chronologies from non-laminated samples using annual chemical variations in stalagmites from two Alpine caves (Obir, Austria and Ernesto, \{NE\} Italy). Trace element data were obtained by ion microprobe analyses for H, P, Mg, Na, Sr and Ba and the annual signal was sought using spectral and wavelet analysis. An automated chemical peak-counting software tool was developed in MATLABÂ©. It counts significant annual peaks using criteria of minimum amplitude in relation to the local standard deviation of signal variation and minimum separation between peaks determined by the thickness of the preceding layers. Verification of the tool using visibly laminated samples suggests the software is a reliable and accurate method of chronology building, with hit ratios greater than 0.93 and less than 0.75% false alarm occurrences. Used in conjunction with other dating methods such as radiocarbon, UâTh and sulphur peak dating, the automated chemical laminae chronology-building approach provides a more meaningful alternative to simple age-depth curve fitting for non-laminated samples. },

For this reason, it is not surprising that the study of radiation interactions with \{MOS\} materials, devices, and circuits has been a major theme of many articles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of structural defects on thermostability and radiation sensitivity of Si \{MOSFET\} dosimeters. It was shown that the near-surface layers of silicon have a complex defective structure which consists from the disordered layer of silicon and the layer of dislocation networks. Grain boundaries of disordered layer form additional energy levels close to the midgap of silicon. These states are ionized under radiation effect and form positive charge. This positive radiation-induced charge becomes additional to the oxide charge and it changes (increases) radiation sensitivity of Si \{MOSFET\} detectors. However, these states are the additional source of charge carriers under temperature increasing and lead to changing of detectorâs parameters. },

The first detector was used to calibrate the source, whereas the possibility of alpha spectroscopy was investigated in the others. A 226Ra source was also used for CR-39 to detect a higher energy (â6.96Â MeV). The data found for CR-39 are in agreement with previous results. \{LR\} 115 and Makrofol presented the characteristic Bragg peak, which indicates that these detectors can be used as alpha spectrometers. Finally, within the applied etching conditions, it was possible to observe energy detection windows for \{LR\} 115 and Makrofol. For the etching conditions employed in this work, maximum energy thresholds were found to be approximately 4.5Â MeV and 3.7Â MeV, for \{LR\} 115 and Makrofol, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate alpha particle tracks from plated-out radon progeny would be naturally excluded if these detectors were used to monitor environmental radon and its progeny, confirming previous results performed with different experimental conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges in dating rock surfaces is the choice of the luminescence mineral. Although quartz is the preferred dosimeter in sediment dating, it is often not sufficiently sensitive when extracted from solid rocks. The intensity of signals from feldspars tends to be much less dependent on geological origin and erosion history, but the dosimetry of K-rich feldspar grains extracted from rocks is complicated because the internal dose rate is very dependent on the original feldspar grain size. The in situ grain size information is lost during the crushing process used to separate the grains for measurement. This latter problem does not apply to Na-rich feldspar because of the absence of internal radioactivity. The potential application of Na-rich feldspar as a luminescence dosimeter for the \{IRSL\} dating of rock surfaces is investigated using a variety of sediment samples from different geological settings for which independent age control is available. The blue and yellow luminescence emissions are measured for \{IR\} stimulation at 50Â Â°C (IR50), and post-IR \{IR\} stimulation at 290Â Â°C (pIRIR290). Thermal stability experiments imply that the corresponding signals in both emissions have comparable thermal stabilities and that all signals have similar recombination kinetics and are thermally stable over geological timescales. The \{IR50\} doses measured using blue and yellow emissions are similar to or lower than quartz doses while pIRIR290 blue doses are higher than those from yellow emission and quartz doses. The fading rates measured for the \{IR50\} signals are â¼3%/decade larger than those measured for the pIRIR290 signals in both yellow and blue emissions. Furthermore the average fading rates of both yellow signals are â¼3%/decade higher than the corresponding fading rates of the blue signals. However, there is no detectable correlation between fading rates and the measured De values. The residual doses measured from the laboratory-bleached samples and a modern analogue suggest that the \{IR50\} signals in both blue and yellow emissions bleach to the same degree, as do the corresponding pIRIR290 signals, and that there is no significant naturally-unbleachable residual dose observed using these signals. Neither anomalous fading nor incomplete bleaching explains the observed dose discrepancy between the two emissions. Eight uncorrected and fading-corrected ages are calculated for each sample based on all four signals, using the dose rate relevant to Na-rich feldspar extracts (i.e. â¼3% K). The \{IR50\} and pIRIR290 blue ages were also calculated assuming a dose rate based on 12.5% internal K (i.e. assuming that the blue signals were mainly derived from contamination by K-rich feldspar). The latter pIRIR290 blue ages are in agreement with the expected age control, raising the possibility that this signal originates mainly from K-rich feldspar contamination in our Na-rich fractions, and thus is not so useful in the luminescence dating of rock surfaces. On the other hand, the pIRIR290 fading-corrected ages based on the yellow emission are consistent with the independent age controls; higher preheat and stimulation temperatures may result in more stable yellow signals from Na-rich feldspar extracts from rocks, and so reduce the size of the fading correction. We conclude that, because this signal avoids the dosimetry difficulties of K-rich feldspar extracts, it has considerable potential in the \{IRSL\} dating of rock surfaces. },

The current radiation protection philosophy and recommendations applied to workers and public from operation of radiation and nuclear applications are based on the linear non-threshold (LNT) model. The inhabitants of \{HBNR\} and radon prone areas receive relatively high radiation doses. Therefore, according to the \{LNT\} concept, the inhabitants in \{HBNR\} areas and in particular those in Ramsar are considered at risk and their exposure should be regulated. The \{HBNR\} areas in the world have different conditions in terms of dose and population. In particular, the inhabitants in \{HBNR\} areas of Ramsar receive very high internal and external exposures. This author believes that the public in such areas should be protected and proposes a plan to remedy high exposure of the inhabitants of the \{HBNR\} areas of Ramsar, while maintaining these areas as they stand to establish a national environmental radioactivity park which can be provisionally called âRamsar Research Natural Radioactivity Parkâ (RRNRP). The major \{HBNR\} areas, the public exposure and the need to remedy exposures of inhabitants are reviewed and discussed. },

The method is based on electrochemical etching (ECE) of nitrogen ion tracks in 1Â mm thick large area polycarbonate (PC) detectors. The \{ECE\} method employed a specially designed and constructed large area \{ECE\} chamber by applying a 50Â Hzâhigh voltage (HV) generator under optimized \{ECE\} conditions. The nitrogen ion tracks and angular distribution were efficiently (constructed for this study) amplified to a point observable by the unaided eyes. The beam profile and angular distribution of nitrogen ion tracks in the central axes of the beam and two- and three-dimensional iso-ion track density distributions showing micro-beam spots were determined. The distribution of ion track density along the central axes versus angular position shows double humps around a dip at the 0Â° angular positions. The method introduced in this paper proved to be quite efficient for ion beam profile and characteristic studies in \{PFDs\} with potential for ion detection studies and other relevant dosimetry applications. },

The useful applications for such dose range are food irradiation treatment, medical devices sterilization and polymer modification. Gamma irradiation of the film induces a significant intensity of green color, which can be characterized by a main absorption band at 627Â nm and a small band at 425Â nm. The variation in response of irradiated film stored in the dark and under laboratory light illumination was less than 3% during the first 6 days of storage. The response of film during irradiation was slightly influenced by relative humidity in the range of 12â76%; however, it was significantly affected by temperature in the range of 5â40Â Â°C. The radiation chemical yield was reported to be 6.76Â ÃÂ 10â6Â mol/J at the absorbed dose of 30Â kGy for the film containing 6.5% of \{LMG\} dye.

A microcontroller controls the complete measurement cycle, processes the digitized signals, performs extensive checks of the system states and communicates via \{USB\} with the external \{PC\} software. The resulting \{OSL\} signal can be used for dose evaluation. Two types of personal dosimeters are available, both conform to the \{IEC\} 62387-1 standard. The dose response is linear from the lowest detection limit of 50Â Î¼Svâ10Â Sv. Long-term fading of the signal is negligible. Due to the near tissue equivalence and the resulting low photon energy dependence of BeO the personal dose can be evaluated from 12Â keV up to 7Â MeV by one dosimetric element without any corrections. In an automatized environment the system is able to process several hundred dosimeters per hour. },

The aim of this study is to evaluate the stability of readout values of the reader and to recommend effective use of reading methods for reducing the uncertainty in dosimetric performance through the investigation of characteristics of a GD-based reader system. The examined glass dosimetry system consists of silver-activated metaphosphate \{GD\} element and a fully automatic readout system. \{GD\} elements were calibrated and exposed using a 60Co teletherapy unit (Theratron 780, AECL, Kanata, Canada). The reproducibility of repeated measurements results show that the readout value is 0.4% lower at fifth measurement, 0.9% lower at tenth measurement, and 1.3% lower at the twentieth measurement, compared to the reference value. The resulting readout values of the \{GD\} elements according to the loading positions were at minimum 0.5% lower, and at maximum, 3.1% higher, with an average of 2.0% higher values compared to the reference readout value in the first position. The interface effect for dose due to the loading number of \{GD\} elements was evaluated to be 1.015, 1.022, and 1.035 times higher in the average dose values for the loading of five \{GD\} elements, ten \{GD\} elements, and twenty \{GD\} elements than the average readout value at the first position, respectively. As a result, in order to get an accurate and precise dose measurement by the \{GD\} reader, if repeated readings are performed, measured values should be corrected according to the number of repeated readings, and the loading of \{GD\} elements in the magazine should constantly be kept in the same position. Moreover, the number of \{GD\} elements loading on the magazine should be decided by considering either accurate and precise dose measurements or numerous relative dose measurements. },

We examined the expanded dosimetric characteristics of \{GDs\} including dose linearity up to 500Â Gy, uniformity among \{GD\} lots and for individual GDs, the angular dependence, and energy dependence of 4 therapeutic x-ray qualities. In addition, we measured the dosimetric features (dose linearity, uniformity, angular dependence, and energy dependence) of the \{GD\} for electron beams of 10 different electron energy qualities. All measurements with the exception of dose linearity for photon beam were performed in a water phantom. For high-energy photon beams, dose linearity has a linear relationship for a dose ranging from 1 to 500Â Gy with the coefficient of determination; \{R2\} of 0.998. The uniformity of each \{GD\} of dose measurements was within Â±0.5% for four \{GD\} lots and within Â±1.2% for 80 GDs. In terms of the effects of photon beam angle, lower absorbed doses of within 1.0% were observed between 60Â° and 105Â° than at 90Â°. The \{GD\} energy dependence of 4 photon beam energy qualities was within Â±2.0%. On the other hand, the result of the dose linearity for high-energy electron beams showed well fitted regression line with the coefficient of determination; \{R2\} of 0.999 between 6 and 20Â MeV. The uniformity of \{GDs\} exposed to the nominal electron energies 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20Â MeV was Â±1.2%. In terms of the angular dependence to electron beams, absorbed doses were within 2.0% between 60Â° and 105Â° than at 90Â°. In evaluation of the energy dependence of the \{GD\} at nominal electron energies between 5 and 20Â MeV, we obtained responses between 1.1% and 3.5% lower than that for a cobalt-60 beam. Our results show that \{GDs\} can be used as a detector for determining doses when a high-energy photon beam is used, and that it also has considerable potential for dose measurement of high-energy electron beam. },

  Abstract                 = {Î±-Al2O3:C phosphor was studied for improvement of its dose threshold using thermally assisted optically stimulated luminescence (TA-OSL) phenomenon. The dose threshold of phosphor depends on the standard deviation of the background signal which affects the signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument. In case of \{OSL\} measurement, the background signal is due to the scattering of the stimulation light intensity from the planchet. On reducing the stimulation light intensity, the scattering component and thus the standard deviation of the background signal reduces considerably. The reduction in stimulation light intensity increases the readout time due to the dependence of decay constant of \{OSL\} signal on the former. The decay constant depends on the photo-ionization cross-section of the \{OSL\} active traps in the phosphor participating in \{OSL\} phenomenon and thus on the readout temperature due to the temperature dependence of photo-ionization cross-section. In order to achieve the same decay constant for two sets of measurements for Î±-Al2O3:C i.e. to take the \{OSL\} measurement in the same time at lower stimulation light intensity as that taken for higher light intensity, the temperature of measurement for Î±-Al2O3:C for the former was raised. Moreover, the increase of readout temperature does not affect the standard deviation in the background signal of \{OSL\} readout. The optimized elevated temperature for Î±-Al2O3:C was found to be 85Â Â°C as the main dosimetric peak starts giving signal due to depletion of its filled traps, at temperatures higher than 90Â Â°C. As a result of lowering the stimulation intensity at higher temperature (85Â Â°C), the standard deviation in the background signal and thus the overall dose threshold of Î±-Al2O3:C was found to improve by 1.8 times. },

  Abstract                 = {Commercially available Î±-Al2O3:C powder was studied for deep energy level defects by a newly suggested method using thermally assisted optically stimulated luminescence (TA-OSL) phenomenon. The method involves simultaneous application of continuous wave optically stimulated luminescence (CW-OSL) as well as thermal stimulation up to 400Â Â°C, using a linear heating rate of 4Â K/s. By using this method, two well-defined peaks at 121Â Â°C and 232Â Â°C were observed. These TA-OSL peaks have been correlated to two different types of deeper defects which can be bleached at 650Â Â°C and 900Â Â°C respectively on thermal treatment. These deeper defects, having larger thermal trap depth and relatively lower photoionization cross-section at room temperature for stimulation with blue \{LED\} (470Â nm), are stable up to 500Â Â°C, so they can store absorbed dose information even if the sample is inadvertently exposed to light or temperature. As only a fraction of signal is bleached during TA-OSL readout, multiple readouts could be performed on an exposed sample using this technique. The dose vs TA-OSL response from deep traps of Î±-Al2O3:C was found to be linear up to 10Â kGy, thus extending its application for high dose dosimetry. The value of thermally assisted energy (EA) associated with these traps in Î±-Al2O3:C has been determined to be 0.268Â eV and 0.485Â eV respectively and the corresponding values of photoionization cross-section at room temperature (25Â Â°C), for optical stimulation with blue light (470Â nm), are 5.82Â ÃÂ 10â20 and 3.70Â ÃÂ 10â22Â cm2, respectively. The process of thermally assisted \{OSL\} has been formulated analytically as well as theoretically for describing the temperature dependence of optical cross-section and evaluation of thermally assisted energy associated with deep traps. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes how humidity, wind and ambient aerosols in air influence the detection responses of passive detectors. Two types of alpha track detectors based on a passive radon (222Rn)âthoron (220Rn) discriminative measurement technique were used: the Raduet and Radopot detectors that were developed and calibrated by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Japan. The initial experiment showed that the infiltration rate of 220Rn onto sponges with a high air exchange rate for the Raduet detectors was one third lower than that onto filters for the Radopot detectors. Little distinct dependence on humidity was observed for the 222Rn detection responses of both detectors. For 220Rn, the detection responses of both detectors for the high air exchange rate seemed to decrease slightly at high humidity conditions. The 220Rn detection responses of the Radopot detectors had little influence from wind speed. The 220Rn detection responses of the Raduet detectors for the high air exchange rate seemed to decrease at low wind speeds. Furthermore, there was little difference between the detection responses in the presence and absence of ambient aerosol particles because the ambient aerosols were filtered out during their passive diffusion through the sponges and filters for the Raduet and Radopot detectors, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {A prototype detector has been built using commercial high quality single crystal epitaxial diamond and novel electrical contacts resulting in two asymmetric Schottky junctions able to operate the detector at zero bias like a photodiode. Aiming at evaluating the detector suitability for radiotherapy applications we report on results related to signal dynamics, linearity with the dose and dose rate, signal stability and measurement repeatability determined in a Co-60 reference beam. In addition, we measured the detector sensitivity and its dependence on the applied bias voltage. The detector has a wide active volume leading to high current signal values. The signal dynamics is wide, with a dark current of 3.2Â ÃÂ 10â14Â A at zero bias and a current of 6.8Â ÃÂ 10â10Â A under irradiation with a dose rate of 0.95Â GyÂ minâ1. The sensitivity to ionizing radiation increases with the bias voltage and values up to 104Â nCÂ Gyâ1Â mmâ3 have been evaluated atÂ â300Â V. When operated atÂ â5Â V, the detector shows a linear response on a wide range of Co-60 dose rates from 1.3Â ÃÂ 10â3Â GyÂ minâ1 to 1.2Â GyÂ minâ1 following the Fowler's power law with a coefficient ÎÂ =Â 0.99Â Â±Â 0.01. The device also shows rise and fall times of less than 1.0Â s with a stability of the signal under irradiation better than 0.3%. The characteristics of the detector, as determined in the Co-60 beam, appear suitable for radiotherapy dosimetry, when fast response on the transient, wide signal dynamics, linearity and high sensitivity are required. },

  Abstract                 = {The alkali halide NaCl (Common salt) is an environmentally-abundant phosphor of considerable potential for retrospective dosimetry and radiological event analysis due to its high sensitivity to ionising radiation when analysed by Thermoluminescence (TL), Optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) or Infrared-stimulated luminescence (IRSL). We report here aspects of luminescence from NaCl relevant to the development of valid protocols for measurement of recent ionising radiation exposure. The timescale of interest in this application is from days to decades, hence our emphasis is on detection and characterisation of \{TL\} emission in the 100â300Â Â°C range, and of \{OSL\} and \{IRSL\} emissions measured following only low temperature preheating (160Â Â°C). A collection of 19 salt samples was assembled, including samples of rock salt and domestic salt produced by evaporation from brine. Analysis of \{TL\} emission spectral changes, together with previously reported TL, \{OSL\} and \{IRSL\} sensitivity changes, confirmed activation of sensitivity change by exposure to temperatures exceeding 160Â Â°C. Kinetic analysis using Chen's method found EÂ =Â 0.943Â eV and sÂ =Â 5.1Â ÃÂ 1011Â sâ1 for the 100Â Â°C \{TL\} peak, giving a lifetime at 20Â Â°C consistent with previous calculations and in the range of 7â14Â h. },

  Abstract                 = {The \{EURADOS\} (European Radiation Dosimetry Group) working group (WG2) on Harmonisation of Individual Monitoring in Europe has shown that intercomparisons are fundamental for harmonisation of individual monitoring. As a result of these considerations, \{EURADOS\} started to prepare a series of continuous intercomparisons for individual monitoring services (IMS) in Europe. \{EURADOS\} has now successfully executed two intercomparison exercises, one for whole body dosemeters (2008) and one for extremity dosemeters (2009). Both exercises were performed without external funding, all costs being covered by the participantsâ fees. More than 120 (!) different â mainly passive â dosimetry systems were tested from all over Europe until now and the results were analysed and compared. Although scientific studies were not the primary objective of these exercises specific additional information about the tested systems supplied by the participants for statistical analysis allows a detailed analysis of these results with respect to different parameters like dosemeter type, detector material, filter thickness or others design parameters. The influence of such parameters on the response values of the dosemeters is analysed and discussed in this paper. Both energy response as well as directional response for beta and photon radiation are considered. The influence of different design parameters e.g. detector material, is analysed by comparing the frequency distribution of the response values for different dosemeter groups. Pronounced differences for different detector materials (LiF:Mg,Ti, LiF:Mg,Cu,P and Li2B4O7/CaSO4) were found. The paper gives a comprehensive overview on the performance of various European dosimetry services and the influence of the dosemeter design on the resulting response values. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract To further improve the accuracy of dose delivery to the patient, several projects are pursuing the integration of linear accelerators with magnetic resonance imaging systems. Generally, this is conceived as the next generation of image-guided radiotherapy. For technical and physical reason it is, however, not clear yet how dosimetry will be conducted as standard methods and might not be easily transferred to systems with clinical magnetic fields. For dosimetry in \{MRI\} accelerators, we have tested plastic scintillation detectors (PSD) coupled to optical fibers. They are suitable for real-time and in-vivo dosimetry in radiation treatments and diagnostics and could be, being all-optical, promising candidates for this application. To study the basic feasibility of using \{PSDs\} with organic scintillators in magnetic fields, we measured the response of these dosimeters in presence of magnetic fields up to 1Â T. In conclusion, we found some deviations up to 7% of the supposed signal. Although the scintillators are of much denser material, we measured the same behavior in signal as in (Meijsing etÂ al., 2009) for a Farmer ionization chamber or as in (Raaijmakers etÂ al., 2007) for films described which indicates radiation field effect rather than changes in the detected response itself. },

  Abstract                 = {Exploiting biogenic carbonates as thermoluminescence dosimeters requires an understanding of trap kinetics and an appropriate sequence with which to measure equivalent dose. The trap kinetics of two high temperature peaks (peaks \{II\} and III) from calcitic snail opercula have been investigated resulting in the calculation of lifetimes of 7.4Â ÃÂ 107 and 1.4Â ÃÂ 1011 years for the two peaks respectively. Two measurement sequences, based upon changes in the application and measurement of a test dose, have been applied to peaks \{II\} and III, and though both methods were equally successful in dose recovery and production of a dose response curve some differences were observed. Primarily, the use of method 1 lead to dose dependant sensitivity change implying competition effects occurring during irradiation; method 2 did not experience this phenomenon. As a consequence method 2 was chosen as the most appropriate protocol for single-aliquot dating of this material. When assessing the \{TL\} behaviour of the two peaks, peak \{II\} performed poorly in dose recovery experiments recovering a dose 60â100% larger than that applied. Disproportionate growth of peak \{II\} in response to a beta dose applied prior to measurement, compared to growth following regeneration doses indicated that peak \{II\} was not suitable for use in single-aliquot protocols. However, dose recovery results for peak \{III\} were all within errors of unity of the given dose, and peak \{III\} was therefore chosen as the most appropriate peak for \{TL\} dosimetry in these single-aliquot procedures. The lifetime of charge in peak \{III\} is sufficient to date over many millions of years, and furthermore using the chosen method 2 the dose response curve has a \{D0\} of 3,250Â Â±Â 163Â Gy allowing dating to over 3 million years. },

Altogether 532 measurements were performed: 53 in winter, 57 in spring, 122 in summer and 300 in autumn. The frequency distribution is well described by a log-normal function. The geometric means of indoor thoron concentration (with geometric standard deviations in brackets) in winter, spring, summer and autumn were obtained to be: 39Â BqÂ mâ3 (3.4), 32Â BqÂ mâ3 (2.8), 18Â BqÂ mâ3 (2.8), 31Â BqÂ mâ3 (2.9), respectively. Seasonal variations of thoron appear lower than those of radon. The seasonal corrected annual mean concentration ranges between 3 and 272Â BqÂ mâ3 with a geometric mean of 28Â BqÂ mâ3 (2.12). A detailed statistical analysis of the geogenic and building factors which influence the indoor thoron concentration is also reported. This survey represents the first national survey on indoor thoron in continental Europe. },

The results of the analysis of the variance showed statistically significant differences among the indoor radon measurements for the regions in different seasons. The influence of the factors linked to building characteristics in relation to radon measurements in different seasons was examined. The factors which enable a differentiation into subgroups (significance level p &lt; 0.05) are the floor level, basement and building materials. },

However, the evaluation of these audits has also shown that there is still considerable scope for improvement in terms of reducing extremity doses and that further measures are therefore required. Facility-specific and person-specific investigations are currently being conducted with the support of the SFOPH. Their aim is to show facilities which operations during the preparation and application of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals lead to high extremity doses. This will enable the reduction of extremity doses for nuclear medicine staff as well as ensure that the dose limits are adhered to, in spite of the increasing numbers of examinations. },

A study concerning the optimization of the use of \{APDs\} in IR/IC was performed in the framework of the \{ORAMED\} project, a Collaborative Project (2008â2011) supported by the European Commission within its 7th Framework Program. This paper reports on tests performed with \{APDs\} on phantoms using an X-ray facility in a hospital environment and \{APDs\} worn by interventionalists during routine practice in different European hospitals. The behaviour of the \{APDs\} is more satisfactory in hospitals than in laboratories with respect to the influence of the tube peak high voltage and pulse width, because the \{APDs\} are tested in scattered fields with dose equivalent rates generally lower than 1 Sv.hâ1. },

  Abstract                 = {The experimentally measured thermoluminescence (TL) glow curves of quartz samples are influenced by the presence of the thermal quenching effect, which involves a variation of the luminescence efficiency as a function of temperature. The real shape of the thermally unquenched \{TL\} glow curves is completely unknown. In the present work an attempt is made to reconstruct these unquenched glow curves from the quenched experimental data, and for two different types of quartz samples. The reconstruction is based on the values of the thermal quenching parameter W (activation energy) and C (a dimensionless constant), which are known from recent experimental work on these two samples. A computerized glow-curve deconvolution (CGCD) analysis was performed twice for both the reconstructed and the experimental \{TL\} glow curves. Special attention was paid to check for consistency between the results of these two independent \{CGCD\} analyses. The investigation showed that the reconstruction attempt was successful, and it is concluded that the analysis of reconstructed \{TL\} glow curves can provide improved values of the kinetic parameters E, s for the glow peaks of quartz. This also leads to a better evaluation of the half-lives of electron trapping levels used for dosimetry and luminescence dating. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation exposure for the staff in nuclear medicine departments is inevitable. After application of radiopharmaceuticals the patient himself becomes a radioactive source. Consequently, we need detailed information on the extent of radiation exposure for each single person dealing with radioactive sources and patients in nuclear medicine. In this work, dose rates of a variety of radioactive sources â radiopharmaceuticals and patients â in nuclear medicine were investigated. For this purpose different detectors (dosimeters, survey-meters) were used and different sources were measured for several distances between source and detector. The âradioactive patientâ as a source can be considered as uncritical. However, this assumption only holds if members of the personnel keep a sufficient distance to the patient of at least 1Â m. If treatments in the vicinity of the patient become necessary, the time spent in a closer distance should be limited. The handling of radiopharmaceuticals often involves close contact to the radioactive source. For the Î²-radiation or in the mixed Î²,Î³-radiation field of several high energy beta emitters (32P, 68Ga, 90Y, 188Re) the ambient dose equivalent rate at 10Â mm depth together with the directional dose equivalent rate at 0Â° and 0.07Â mm depth have to be determined. Especially for the beta emitters mentioned above these dose rates are very high. For instance the specific dose rate for 90Y yields 4.6Â Sv/(GBqâh) when dose rate measurements were performed in the closest distance to a glass vial that was practicable. Survey-meters that are only capable of measuring photons fail to provide even a rough approximation of the actual dose rate. Preparations of radiopharmaceuticals with these nuclides may consequently cause a high extremity exposure of laboratory staff. This requires measurements, demands training and a strict compliance with the established radiation safety standards. },

The stability of the radiation-induced \{ESR\} signal at cold (â4Â Â°C) and room (25Â Â°C) temperatures was studied over a storage period of 24 weeks. Irradiated rice noodle samples exhibited a strong, symmetric doublet \{ESR\} signal centered at gÂ =Â 2.0, whereas unirradiated noodle exhibited a very weak signal. The \{ESR\} signal intensity increased linearly with radiation dose ranging from 0.5 to 3Â kGy. Keeping the samples atÂ â4Â Â°C and 25Â Â°C for 24 weeks caused decreases of 50% and 90% in the \{ESR\} signal intensities, respectively.

It was found that the \{RAD7\} thoron sensitivity increased with increasing flow of gas, reaching a maximum value 33.33Â ÃÂ 10â6Â m3Â sâ1 and decreased thereafter.

The ratio of the increase in the dose rates when the projectile is changed from the lighter to the heavier isotopes is fairly reproduced by most of the empirical formulations and the \{PACE\} code. A previously reported relation for the slope parameter is used to predict the directional distribution of the neutron dose for the projectiles used in this study. The calculated doses are lower than the experimental results in the forward directions but agree within the uncertainties at the backward directions.

The effect of deep traps on the behavior of the CW-OSL curves of anion-defective corundum was studied. It was found that the filling of deep traps essentially increases the \{TL\} yield with a dosimetric peak at 450Â K and the CW-OSL-yield under stimulation with blue and white LEDs.

  Abstract                 = {Biodosimetry has the potential to provide the information needed from individuals to respond to unplanned exposures to ionizing radiation in a way that enables the medical response system to function effectively. Four types of circumstances are considered: (1) triage for large scale events, (2) medical management of \{ARS\} following a large scale event, (3) medical management of small scale events, and (4) assessment of long-term risks. There are two different but potentially complementary types of biodosimetry: those based on an individualâs biological responses or on physical phenomena. Because of the different nature of these types of biodosimetry, they have different strengths and limitations that, if considered carefully, lead to their appropriate use in specified circumstances. The biologically based parameters have the possible clinical advantage of reflecting the biological consequences of the radiation. However, their limitations include that the responses potentially may be confounded by: (1) inherent differences in the response to damage in individuals; (2) prior or concurrent pathophysiologically-based processes; and (3) changes over time in an individualâs response to radiation after the exposure. The physically-based parameters are less likely to be perturbed by these factors but have the potential limitations that they measure only the dose at the body location measured, and cannot reflect the biological implications of responding to the dose. Based on the respective strengths and weaknesses of biologically based and physically-based biodosimetry, we suggest that, for exposures to large numbers of people, the physically-based parameters may be especially useful for initial triage, while the biologically based parameters may be especially useful for guiding acute and long-term treatment. For exposures involving small numbers of people, biodosimetry is likely to have a secondary role. For determination of long-term effects of radiation, biodosimetry is likely to remain the principal method for assessing doseâresponse relationships. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Following the recent \{ICRP\} recommendation to decrease the limit of occupational exposure to the eye lens from 150Â mSv to 20Â mSv/year, a dedicated individual eye-lens dosemeter, EYE-Dâ¢, was developed at the \{IFJ\} PAN. This dosemeter uses MCP-N (LiF:Mg,Cu,P) thermoluminescent detectors covered with a polyamide capsule and was so far optimized to achieve a flat photon energy and angular response for X-ray exposures typical in interventional radiology. To verify the applicability of this eye-lens dosemeter in external Î²-ray fields which arise, e.g. in nuclear medicine procedures, we measured and calculated its Î²-ray energy and angular response. Measurements, applying Î²-rays from Sr-90/Y-90 isotope, were performed at the Beta Secondary Standard type 2 (BSS 2) in CLOR. Calculations, using the \{PENELOPE\} Monte Carlo transport code which simulates coupled electron and photon transport in arbitrary materials, were performed for P-32, K-42 and Sr-90/Y-90 fields to simulate doses received by the eye lens within the human body. \{PENELOPE\} Monte Carlo transport code was also used to calculate doses received with EYE-Dâ¢ detectors. We found good agreement between the measured and calculated energy and angular responses which confirms the suitability of this dosemeter in assessing Hp(3) to estimate the eye lens. Obtained results and conclusions, however preliminary, conform with current \{ICRP\} recommendations when performing individual radiation protection dosimetry in external Î²-ray fields occurring in nuclear industry and nuclear medicine activities. },

  Abstract                 = {We report on a positive attempt on the applicability of PM-355 solid-state nuclear track detectors as integrated neutron fluence sensors for monitoring the level of neutrons during full radiotherapy treatment of prostate cancer patients using the \{IMRT\} technique with 15Â MeV X rays. We also report on the applicability of the activation detector 58Ni(n,p)58Co as an integrated fluence detector for the same purpose. Studies were performed at different positions in the treatment room of the Varian Clinac 2300 accelerator at the Oncology Centre in Warsaw. Both detectors were calibrated in the field of a 252Cf neutron source. The results of neutron fluence measurements at different points from the conversion target are around 106Â n/cm2Â Gy. The same results were obtained from the activity readings of the Ni detector. It can be concluded that both types of detectors are suitable for monitoring the integrated neutron fluence for the purposes of estimating the epidemiological risk of the treated patients. },

A dozen or so PM-355 detector samples were cut out from detector sheets delivered at different times and were irradiated with mono-energetic protons, deurerons and helium ions of energy ranging up to a few MeV. After that, the samples were etched and track opening diameters were determined as a function of particle energy and detector etching time. These studies were motivated by the application of the detectors in fusion experiments to measure energetic ions which escape high-temperature plasmas. The calibration diagrams obtained enable us to compare the relative sensitivities of detectors from different batches and to use these detectors in an optimal way. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractAim Neutron-activated holmium-166 (166Ho) is an excellent radionuclide for internal radiation therapy (EÎ²maxÂ =Â 1.84Â MeV) with an appropriate half-life (26.8Â h), which emits photons (81Â keV, 6.2%) suitable to be detected by gamma cameras. Preparing and injecting radiopharmaceuticals containing beta/gamma emitting holmium-166 implies a risk of exceeding the upper limit for skin and hand radiation equivalent doses (500Â mSv/an). This study was aimed to estimate the whole body and finger exposure for staff responsible for dose preparation, dose dispensing, and dose injection of holmium-166 therapy. Methods To measure the finger dose from external exposure, all staff members wore \{TLD\} dosimeters. Personal dose equivalents Hp(10) were measured using electronic personal dosimeters (EPD MK2, Thermo Fischer Scientific) placed on the left side of the chest. During our study, staff members administered more than 40 166Ho-based therapies for preclinical trial. Appropriate radiation safety procedures and shielding were applied at each stage. Results In this study, the whole body doses were 2.80Â Â±Â 1.56Â nSvÂ MBqâ1 for one 166Ho-therapy preparation/formulation, and 2.68Â Â±Â 1.70Â nSvÂ MBqâ1 for one intravenous injection. Maximum finger doses were 2.9Â Â±Â 0.2Â Î¼SvÂ MBqâ1 and 2.5Â Â±Â 0.3Â Î¼SvÂ MBqâ1 for preparation and injection, respectively (activities injected: 72Â Â±Â 3Â MBq). Conclusion Extrapolated annual doses from 300 166Ho radionuclide therapies were lower than the annual limit doses for skin and the whole body, 500Â mSv and 20Â mSv, respectively, reported in the European Directive \{EURATOM\} 96/29 when applying appropriate radiation protection standards. However, these doses have to be added to other diagnostic or therapeutic protocols, performed in preclinical facilities. },

  Abstract                 = {The Coded Aperture Imaging (CAI) technique has been applied with CR-39 nuclear track detectors to image alpha particle source spatial distributions. The experimental setup comprised: a 226Ra source of alpha particles, a laser-machined \{CAI\} mask, and CR-39 detectors, arranged inside a vacuum enclosure. Three different alpha particle source shapes were synthesized by using a linear translator to move the 226Ra source within the vacuum enclosure. The coded mask pattern used is based on a Singer Cyclic Difference Set, with 400 pixels and 57 open square holes (representing ÏÂ =Â 1/7Â =Â 14.3% open fraction). After etching of the CR-39 detectors, the area, circularity, mean optical density and positions of all candidate tracks were measured by an automated scanning system. Appropriate criteria were used to select alpha particle tracks, and a decoding algorithm applied to the (x, y) data produced the de-coded image of the source. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values obtained for alpha particle \{CAI\} images were found to be substantially better than those for corresponding pinhole images, although the CAI-SNR values were below the predictions of theoretical formulae. Monte Carlo simulations of \{CAI\} and pinhole imaging were performed in order to validate the theoretical \{SNR\} formulae and also our \{CAI\} decoding algorithm. There was found to be good agreement between the theoretical formulae and \{SNR\} values obtained from simulations. Possible reasons for the lower \{SNR\} obtained for the experimental \{CAI\} study are discussed. },

The \{ZFT\} dating and decomposition results indicate the age populations can be divided into three periods, which are 213Â Â±Â 21Â Maâ230Â Â±Â 21Â Ma, 252Â Â±Â 32Â Maâ304Â Â±Â 21Â Ma and 378Â Â±Â 39Â Maâ933Â Â±Â 16Â Ma. These periods are less than, close to and greater than the depositional age, respectively. The continental collision between the north and south China plates impacted on its thermal and structural evolution strongly, but it is possible the burial and magmatism merely resulted in partial annealing on ZFT. Obvious differences of structural and thermal evolution exist in both the \{EW\} and \{NS\} directions. And the differences in the \{EW\} direction were mainly resulted from the tectonic movements in late Indosinian and Yanshanian, but the \{NS\} direction differences were on account of the magmatic activity in Yanshanian. },

  Abstract                 = {Tailings produced during mining and milling of uranium ores represent potentially large volumes of low level radioactive materials. A typical environmental problem associated with mill tailings is radon emanation. Covering tailings is widely applied to reduce radon exhalation rate. In this paper, the fractal theories and field covering tests are used to study the fractal characters of size distribution of six types of covering materials, including waste rock, sand, laterite, kaolin, mixture of sand and laterite, and mixture of waste rock and laterite, and their influences on radon exhalation. The size distributions of uranium tailings and the six aforementioned covering materials all exhibit a good fractal structure. The contents of fine grain increase with the increasing value of fractal dimension. The results of field radon measurement show that the radon emanation rate of tailings without covers is 14.7â18.6Â Bq/m2Â s. Covering tests were carried out of the six abovementioned covering materials with thickness of 0.4Â m, 0.8Â m, 1.2Â m, 1.6Â m and 2.0Â m. The results indicate that the application of these materials for cover layers can decrease the radon exhalation rate markedly. The effectiveness of a cover layer in reducing radon exhalation is related to its fractal texture of size distribution. Under the same thickness conditions, the attenuation coefficient of radon exhalation rate increases with the increasing fractal dimension of size distribution of covers. The empirical expressions of the attenuation coefficients in relation to fractal dimension D of size distribution and thickness x of covers is obtained for evaluating the effectiveness of final covers for uranium tailings impoundments. },

This model is based on a combination of the âaccumulation chamberâ technique and a radon monitor. The radon monitor is used to perform measurement of radon concentration evolution inside the accumulation chamber, and radon exhalation rate is evaluated via nonlinear least-square fitting of the measured data. If the flow rate of the pump is high enough, radon concentration in the detector's internal cell becomes to be equal to that in the accumulation chamber quickly, and the simple model for measuring the radon exhalation rate can be generated analytically. Generally, the pump flow rate of radon monitor is low, not satisfying the condition. We find other sufficient conditions of this simplified model. On these conditions, the radon exhalation rate can be calculated accurately through this model even the flow rate of the pump is not so high. This method can be applied to develop and improve the instruments for measuring the radon exhalation rate. },

This paper presents a fast method for measuring radon exhalation from medium surface with a ventilation-type accumulation chamber by the \{RAD7\} while making the effects of leakage and back diffusion negligible. The radon exhalation rate can be obtained from the measured values before radioactive equilibrium between Radon and progeny occurs. This method is based on the principle for tracing radon concentration changes by deriving 222Rn concentrations through 218Po measurements. Several radon exhalation rate measurements of medium surface have been performed in the Radon Laboratory of the University of South China. The radon exhalation rates obtained by verification experiments are within the accepted values for the reference value. },

  Abstract                 = {The dependence of thermoluminescence (TL) of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si on sintering temperatures and dopants concentrations were investigated. The dependency of the \{TL\} in LiF:Mg,Cu,Si on sintering temperature exhibits a very sharp maximum at 830Â Â°C. LiF:Mg,Cu,Si is much too sensitive than LiF:Mg,Cu,P to sintering temperature. The glow curve and the \{TL\} sensitivity depend on the concentration of Mg, Cu and Si, showing a distinct maximum for certain concentrations of these impurities. Mg seems to be the most essential dopant, as very small changes of the Mg content strongly influence both the glow curve and the \{TL\} sensitivity. Si is the main activator responsible for \{TL\} emission. The stability to heat treatments in LiF:Mg,Cu,Si was influenced greatly by Mg concentrations. The thermal instability in LiF:Mg,Cu,Si is caused not by Cu and Si but Mg ion state change. It was found that the optimum concentrations are Mg:0.6Â mol%, Cu:0.03Â mol% and Si:0.9Â mol% for this material, which showed the best stability to heat treatment. },

The shape of the glow curve for LiF:Mg,Cu,Si is similar to that for standard LiF:Mg,Cu,P (GR-200A), and shows minimal differences when annealed in the range from 260Â Â°C to 290Â Â°C for 10Â min. The \{TL\} sensitivity for LiF:Mg,Cu,Si is much lower than that for GR-200A, but is 35 times larger than that for TLD-100 and is slightly higher than that for HMCP. The height of the high-temperature peaks for LiF:Mg,Cu,Si is not only lower than that for GR-200A, but also lower than that for HMCP. The glow curve shape of LiF:Mg,Cu,Si annealed at 260Â Â°C for different times shows minimal differences and \{TL\} response remains stable. These results indicate that the new LiF:Mg,Cu,Si disc has a good stability to thermal treatments and a lower residual \{TL\} signal. },

As the \{TA\} increased, the intensity decreased rapidly to almost no signal at 340â380Â Â°C then increased clearly and achieved a maximum at 540Â Â°C. The position of the maximum intensity of the glow curve shifted basically in the direction of higher temperatures with an increase at \{TA\} and achieved a maximum of 279Â Â°C when annealed at 460Â Â°C. The re-annealing influenced both the intensity and the glow curve structure at certain degree. The effect of re-annealing on the glow curve depended markedly on the TA. With re-annealing at 240Â Â°C, the intensity decreased as \{TA\} increased up to 360Â Â°C then increased and achieved a maximum at 540Â Â°C. The intensity could be restored fully when annealed at above 500Â Â°C, however, the glow curve couldn't be restored fully. With a combined annealing, the shape of glow curve of a sample annealed at above 540Â Â°C or below 320Â Â°C was similar to that of the standard glow curve of LiF:Mg,Cu,P and the intensity and glow curve could be restored completely when annealed in the range 620â660Â Â°C. It seems that the main roles of the re-annealing at 240Â Â°C are to restore partially the intensity of peak 4 and peak shape for LiF:Mg,Cu,P when annealed at above 260Â Â°C, and restore fully the total \{TL\} intensity of LiF:Mg,Cu,P when annealed at above 500Â Â°C and the main roles of the combined re-annealing are to reduce the intensity of peak 5 and the total \{TL\} intensity, increase the intensity of peak 4 and restore the glow curve shape. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Isothermal thermoluminescence (ITL) and thermoluminescence (TL) signals from quartz were studied. A single aliquot regenerative dose protocol has been applied for \{ITL\} De determination (SAR-ITL). In the SAR-ITL protocol, the preheat condition was a cutheat to 10Â Â°C higher than measurement temperature. The test dose was approximate to the expected De, and a 450Â Â°C heat was given at end of each cycle to minimize signal build-up. Based on signals strength and dose recovery test, temperatures of 235 and 255Â Â°C were selected for the \{ITL\} De measurement. A multiple aliquots regenerative protocol has been applied for \{TL\} De determination (MAR-TL). The preheat procedure was a cutheat of 235Â Â°C and a second glow \{TL\} of 175Â Gy was used for normalization. The sensitivity change of first heating to 450Â Â°C was negligible, supported by comparison between additive and regenerative dose growth curves. Based on the natural \{TL\} signal and preheat condition studies, De values at temperatures of 250â330Â Â°C were used for thermochronological study. These two protocols were applied to rock samples collected at different elevations from Nujiang River (also called Salween River) valley slope. The SAR-ITL gave De results consistent with the MAR-TL at temperatures of 40â50 Â°C higher. The results clearly demonstrate the differences in the thermal histories between the analyzed samples. The SAR-ITL and MAR-TL protocols were both found to be suitable for application in thermochronology. },

In this paper, we first describe a method to obtain a water-equivalent absorbed dose by combining data from these two types of detector. In order to increase the reliability of \{PADLES\} for \{ISS\} space radiation dosimetry, we investigated the following characteristics of MSO-S TLDs: calibration of our ThermoLuminescence (TL) readout system for high-energy protons and gamma rays from 60Co and 137Cs sources; dose responses for high-energy heavy ions (He, C, Si, Ar, Fe); response variation of different manufacture batches; directional response for the high-energy protons; the initial variations and long-term fading effects of the \{TL\} response for high-energy protons and heavy ions at temperatures fromÂ â80Â Â°C to 60Â Â°C; and \{LET\} response. },

The small probes are capable of measuring fields of high dose rate gradients and the sealed probe-tip qualifies for applications in the fluid milieu and even for in-vivo-dosimetry. One problem of fiber optic dosimetry is the generation of Cherenkov radiation and fiber luminescence in the irradiated light guide, the so called stem effect. Ruby (Al2O3:Cr) has a narrow radioluminescent emission at 694Â nm and is a potential luminophor for fiber optic radioluminescence dosimetry. In this work the influence of the stem effect on our ruby-based fiber optic dosimetry system is examined. The behavior of ruby probes under irradiation up to 0.5Â kGy, as well as their luminescence decay characteristics and the applicability for measurements in radiotherapeutic fields are investigated. },

We first compare gamma dose distributions and the relative sensitivity of the two instruments is investigated using a single sample, by comparing the number of grains accepted into a dose distribution. \{EMCCD\} cross-talk is shown to be of concern at low light levels. We also make use of the fact that the \{EMCCD\} can observe \{TL\} signals from individual grains to examine the use of the correlation between the quartz 110Â Â°CÂ TL peak and the fast component \{OSL\} signal to correct for sensitivity change. Finally, we present the \{OSL\} dose distributions from a set of both well-bleached and poorly-bleached sedimentary samples. From a comparison of the measured doses, we conclude that the two instruments give indistinguishable dose estimates and dispersions, despite the fact that the laser-based system is effectively about four times as sensitive as the EMCCD. },

  Abstract                 = {The use of single grain quartz \{OSL\} dating has become widespread over the past decade, particularly with application to samples likely to have been incompletely bleached before burial. By reducing the aliquot size to a single grain the probability of identifying the grain population most likely to have been well-bleached at deposition is maximised and thus the accuracy with which the equivalent dose can be determined is â at least in principle â improved. However, analysis of single grain dose distributions requires knowledge of the dispersion of the well-bleached part of the dose distribution. This can be estimated by measurement of a suitable analogue, e.g. a well-bleached aeolian sample, but this requires such an analogue to be available, and in addition the assumptions that the sample is in fact a) well-bleached, and b) has a similar dose rate heterogeneity to the fossil deposit. Finally, it is an implicit assumption in such analysis that any over-dispersion is not significantly dose dependent. In this study we have undertaken laboratory investigations of the dose dependency of over-dispersion using a well-bleached modern sample with an average measured dose of 36Â Â±Â 3Â mGy. This sample was prepared as heated (750Â Â°C for 1Â h), bleached and untreated portions which were then given uniform gamma doses ranging from 100Â mGy to 208Â Gy. We show that for these samples the relative laboratory over-dispersion is not constant as a function of dose and that the over-dispersion is smaller in heated samples. We also show that the dim grains in the distributions have a greater over-dispersion than the bright grains, implying that insensitive samples will have greater values of over-dispersion than sensitive samples. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract SAR-OSL investigations on quartz from Romanian loess resulted in non concordant fine and coarse-grain ages for equivalent doses higher than â¼100Â Gy. The laboratory dose response for both grain sizes is well represented by a sum of two saturating exponential functions, fine and coarse grains characterised by \{D01\} and \{D02\} values of â¼140 and â¼1400Â Gy and â¼65 and â¼650Â Gy respectively. Pulsed \{OSL\} experiments confirmed that this behaviour is almost certainly inherent to quartz and not caused by contamination with another mineral. Natural doseâresponse curves do not follow the same pattern and enter saturation much earlier. Analysis of time resolved spectra indicated similar luminescence lifetimes for both fine and coarse quartz grains, and natural and laboratory generated \{OSL\} signals seem to use the same non-dose-dependent recombination pathways. The natural signals of a sample with an expected equivalent dose of 2000â2500Â Gy were found to be below the saturation level of the laboratory dose response curve for both grain sizes; this also applied to the luminescence signals measured after &gt;5000Â Gy given on top of natural doses. },

This behaviour would result in higher equivalent doses being obtained. Here we document the characteristics of \{OSL\} signals from fine (4â11Â Î¼m) and coarse (63â90Â Î¼m) quartz extracted from Romanian loess that display such behaviour. For very high doses (&gt;1Â kGy up to 5â15Â kGy) the data could be closely fitted to a double saturating exponential regression model. Nonetheless, the saturation charcteristics of these fine and coarse quartz grains are very different, with average saturation chracteristic doses of D01Â âÂ 175Â Gy and D02Â âÂ 1800Â Gy in the case of the fine material, while in the case of the coarse material values of D01Â âÂ 55Â Gy and D02Â âÂ 600Â Gy have been obtained. Our results imply a hitherto unexplained mechanism in \{OSL\} production at high doses and question the reliability of obtaining SAR-OSL equivalent doses in the high dose region when a second function is needed to describe the dose response. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The possibility of using the parameters involved in the \{ESR\} dating of optically bleached quartz grains in a purpose of source determination was checked. In that aim, samples previously taken in different sedimentary formations of the Middle Loire Basin (Central France) and dated by \{ESR\} have been observed. First discrimination was made using the thorium and potassium content in the sediments obtained by gamma spectrometry. The plot of these 119 data on the Th/K Schlumberger diagram clearly demonstrated that it was possible to discriminate the clays associations included in the sediment from which the dated quartz are extracted. Clay's nature could then be indicative of the geological nature of the substratum of rivers from their sources. Second discrimination was made using the \{ESR\} intensities calculated from Al, TiâH and TiâLi paramagnetic centres on 18 samples. It appears that the combination of the non-bleachable aluminum trap (DAT) saturation intensity and the TiâH/TiâLi ratio intensities make possible the discrimination of the two main sources of the sediment: Massif Central and Paris Basin. More deeply, The Ti/OBAT (Optically bleachable aluminum traps) intensities made possible the discrimination of quartz grains of different geological sources or with different geothermal history within the Massif Central group. },

  Abstract                 = {Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) can be used as a method to estimate the age of sediment deposition using the paramagnetic centre related to aluminium impurities in quartz. This so-called Al-centre can be partially optically bleached and its signal intensity decreases in relation to time exposure to solar light, until it reaches a plateau value corresponding to a residual signal. This signal can be attributed to âDeep Aluminium Trapsâ (DAT) which cannot be reset by an exposure to sunlight. In this study, we have investigated the behaviour of the \{DAT\} signal in samples from different origins and ages. The intensity of the \{DAT\} signal has been isolated from the total aluminium signal by the exposure of different quartz samples to simulated solar light. We observed that the \{DAT\} intensities were sample dependant and therefore it should be determined for each sample. Moreover, \{DAT\} intensities of Pleistocene volcanic quartz increase with gamma laboratory irradiation, whereas \{DAT\} intensities of sedimentary quartz do not vary with added artificial doses. This suggests that \{DAT\} in quartz extracted from sediments must be inherited from the primary source of the quartz, and were saturated at the time of sedimentation. We thereby validate the \{ESR\} dating of quartz sediment protocol used so far. },

  Abstract                 = {The first passive radon monitor was termed radon film-badge, in analogy with the neutron film-badge. This monitor, instead of a radon film-badge, should be considered the first diffusion chamber, the principle of which has been exploited in all existing passive radon-monitors. In the present paper, a true radon film-badge is proposed, which is formed by a thin-film radiator with suitable radon-sorption characteristics, facing a track detector. At the nanometer scale, the sorption in these radiators occurs by trapping the nanometers particles, formed by the radon atoms, into the nanoholes of technological advanced materials. When compared with existing passive radon-monitors, these radon film-badges present several advantages, such as a wide linearity of response, any desired response sensitivity, a unique simplicity in measuring radon in soil and in water. Radon-decay-products attach to airborne particles and thus acquire a wide range of sizes both in nanometer and micrometer scales. By employing a strategy similar to that used for neutrons, a very compact badge has been recently proposed, which shows promise for the solution of the complex problem of the radon-decay product dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {In Italy an extensive survey has been carried out with the aim to evaluate annual average radon concentration in underground workplaces. The survey covered 933 underground rooms located in 311 bank workplaces spread throughout in all Italian regions; at this scope the sampling was stratified random in order to be representative on national scale. The annual radon concentration was estimated by using passive radon dosemeters (NRPB/SSI type holder and CR-39 as detector): the devices were exposed for a period of about 3 months and 4 cycles were performed to cover a solar year. The radon levels in underground workplaces ranged from 27 to 4851Â Bq/m3 with an overall mean value of 153Â Bq/m3. As expected, radon distribution is not uniform throughout Italy: in several regions high radon annual averages have been found, confirming previous surveys. The analysis of data shows a high variability among regions and intra-region but low spread among rooms belonging to the same workplace. About 5% of underground workplaces displayed radon concentration exceeding 400Â Bq/m3, and the 4.4% exceeds 500Â Bq/m3, the national action level for the exposure to natural radioactivity in workplaces. },

In this paper glass substrates of the window display of 100 mobile phones of different trademarks were analized by X-band cw-EPR before and after irradiation at 100Â Gy. The objective of this study was to highlight some issues of \{EPR\} measurements of glass related to inter-sample variability of: i) signal line shape in irradiated and unirradiated glass; ii) signal intensity loss and line shape change with post-irradiation time; iii) signal changes induced by sample preparation and iv) signal changes induced by thermal annealing. Scope of the paper is to provide a phenomenological picture of the observed effects in order to give a warning about possible problems and to provide suggestions for future work. Explanation of the mechanisms and the causes leading to the observed effects was beyond the scope of this work. These preliminary results confirm that glass substrate of mobile phone displays should be considered as a fortuitous dosimeter in radiation accidents. However, albeit very promising, mineral glass presents a number of issues that should be thoroughly investigated and addressed in future work. },

  Abstract                 = {Objective Triple rule-out (TRO) computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is a protocol which allows evaluation of coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries and adjacent intrathoracic structures for patients with acute chest pain. Retrospective ECG-gated (RGH) is generally used for \{TRO\} \{CTA\} while the feasibility of using ECG-gated tube current modulation (ETCM) or prospective ECG-triggering (PGT) protocols have not been fully investigated. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for dose reduction through the use of \{ETCM\} and \{PGT\} in \{TRO\} \{CTA\} examination as compared with routine \{RGH\} protocols. Material and methods All \{TRO\} \{CTA\} examinations were performed on a 256-slice \{CT\} scanner using an anthropomorphic phantom. To determine equivalent doses for different organs, thermal-luminance dosimeters (TLDs) were placed in different positions in the organs during the scanning and effective doses were calculated based on ICRP-103 guidelines. Effective doses calculated from volume \{CT\} dose index (CTDIvol) were also compared with those obtained from \{TLD\} measurements. Results From the study, the mean effective dose for RGH, \{ETCM\} and \{PGT\} scanning was 21.54Â mSv, 15.52Â mSv and 10.75Â mSv respectively. The doses for \{ETCM\} and \{PGT\} techniques were significantly reduced by 27% and 50% (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) as compared to that for RGH. Effective doses calculated from \{CTDI\} method for three protocols were no significantly difference compared with those obtained from \{TLD\} measurements. Conclusion Radiation dose could be efficiently reduced by applying the \{ETCM\} and \{PGT\} protocols in the 256-slice \{TRO\} \{CTA\} examinations. },

However, interventional fluoroscopy procedures may present deterministic and stochastic radiation risks. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the Food and Drug Administration have requested identifying procedures that may involve patient doses greater than the recommended thresholds. In this study, radiochromic dosimetric media, known as self-developing films, and measurement-based Monte Carlo simulations were used to establish an interventional radiology dosing system for individual patients undergoing interventional transcatheter arterial embolization. The peak skin dose, evaluated from the entrance surface dose distribution, was 21% less than the cumulated dose reported from the console. A 3D dose map incorporated into \{CT\} images was established. The organ doses and effective doses for individual patients were evaluated using this dosing system. This system could be applied very well to other fluoroscopic or interventional procedures for patient dose management. },

According to the radiometric measurements the total alpha-radioactivity of the ground waters is basically associated with the uranium content in the water systems and the seasonal variation is mainly related to meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature and atmospheric precipitation). Assessments of the radiation exposure to population suggests that using these ground waters for human consumption would result in significantly increased radiation doses, whereas utilization of these waters for irrigation purposes wouldnât imply any excessive radiation exposure to population. },

After preheating to a higher temperature (320Â Â°C for 60Â s) all samples show a \{TL\} reduction around 410Â Â°C in the blue detection window. Pulse annealing experiments for \{IRSL\} and pIRIR signals for preheats between 320Â Â°C and 500Â Â°C indicate that the signal stabilities are similar among the different feldspar types, when a higher preheat temperature (&gt;320Â Â°C) is used. Thermal activation energies for \{IRSL\} and pIRIR signals are largest in K-feldspar and smallest in polymineral fine grains, in both blue and \{UV\} detection windows for both fast time-resolved (TR) and continuous wave (CW) signals. These results suggest that \{IRSL\} and pIRIR signals in polymineral fine grains originate mainly from Na-feldspar grains; these signals are less thermally stable than those from K-feldspar, but a more stable signal (presumably from K-feldspar grains) can be obtained using a higher preheat temperature. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Equivalent dose (De) estimations in electron spin resonance (ESR) dating have mostly been done by the multiple aliquot additive dose (MAAD) method despite disadvantages. In this study, we used X-ray irradiations and applied the single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) technique to \{ESR\} De measurements of a volcanic quartz with independent age control. As the \{SAR\} protocol involves multiple steps of irradiations and readouts during a short period of time using a single aliquot, the thermal stabilities of the Al and Ti centres from natural and X-ray irradiated aliquots were compared by a pulse annealing test. The thermal stability of natural and regenerated \{ESR\} signals is significantly different for both Al and Ti centres and preheats are therefore considered necessary after artificial irradiations. The X-ray dose rate for quartz was calibrated using the same sample which was heated and irradiated with a known gamma dose. The \{SAR\} De values using the natural sample were obtained by means of a preheat plateau test. To check and correct for possible sensitivity change induced by the annealing used to reset the natural \{ESR\} signals, the single aliquot regeneration and added dose (SARA) method was applied. The \{SARA\} De values for the Al and Ti centres were in agreement, however, this De value overestimated the expected De from the independent age control, possibly because our sample was too old for the \{SARA\} method. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An anomalous increase in radon concentration was measured at the Nakaizu observatory on the Izu Peninsula prior to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake using a custom-made radon counter. Since the increase was more than three times the standard deviation of radon concentration variations over 35 years of recorded data, it is considered likely that it is a precursor to the earthquake. Following the earthquake, the radon concentration decreased exponentially to the background level. The anomalous increase is explained using a modified volatilization model containing three important aquifer parameters: the groundwater saturation ratio, the fracture surface area per unit volume, and the porosity. The modified model can also explain the radon concentration behavior prior to the 1978 Izu-Oshima-Kinkai earthquake. },

The radon progenies collection rate of a small Mylar foil (3Â cm2) is equivalent to an air sampler with a flow rate of approximately 0.1Â m3/h.

We are developing a fast neutron detector based on the combination of a thin plastic scintillator and the Timepix particle tracking detector. A fast neutron recoils a proton in the scintillator. The light in the scintillator is detected by a Silicon Photo-Multiplier (SiPM). The recoiled proton leaves the plastic scintillator, hits the tracking detector (256Â ÃÂ 256 pixels, 55Â Î¼m pitch, the total sensor area is 1.4Â ÃÂ 1.4Â cm2, thickness is 300Â Î¼m) and generates a track. The track is analyzed and the energy and direction of the proton is recovered. That, together with the energy recorded by the SiPM, is used to reconstruct the energy or direction of the incoming neutron. The fast neutron detection process was studied by means of Monte-Carlo simulation. Description of the simulation and comparison of simulation results with a measurement is presented. Problems in the neutron energy reconstruction caused by protons passing through the 300Â Î¼m thick Silicon sensor are discussed, and a solution based on utilization of the detector response matrix is shown. },

Optimum \{TL\} was obtained for the sample having 0.1Â mol% concentration of Dy in MgSO4 system. Slight increase in intensity of 110Â Â°C peak was observed when the \{TL\} glow curve was recorded after deforming the irradiated samples by dropping a piston of mass 0.4Â kg onto it from the height of 0.2Â m. Further increasing the height from which the piston was being dropped \{TL\} peak intensity of 110Â Â°C decreased. However, 150Â Â°C and 220Â Â°C \{TL\} peak intensity decreased with deformation. Result showed that trap centers associated with 150Â Â°C and nearby \{TL\} peaks were most mechanically unstable. \{TL\} spectrum of MgSO4:Dy phosphors was also recorded. Two peaks one at 490Â nm and another at 590Â nm were observed. In the \{TL\} emission spectra recorded for deformed samples, no significant change was seen in the peak positions. However, peak intensity was reduced. It is suggested that the recombination of electrons released from the traps during the thermal excitation is responsible for the \{TL\} emission in this system. It seems that in MgSO4:Dy system deformation does not cause any appreciable change in the recombination mechanism, it causes redistribution of traps and therefore change in relative \{TL\} intensity occurs in the same spectral region. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Archaeological mortars are more convenient and much more representative for the chronology of buildings than brick or wood constructions that can be re-used from older buildings. Before dating unknown samples of mortars, further investigation of \{OSL\} from mortars is required and the most efficient methodology needs to be established. In this study we compared the ages obtained by \{OSL\} dating of quartz extracted from mortars of the Roman amphitheatre Palais-Gallien in Bordeaux with independent age information. Resetting of the \{OSL\} signal occurred during the preparation of mortar when grains of sand (quartz) were extracted and mixed with lime and water. The mortar was subsequently hidden from light by embedding within the structure which is the event to be dated. Various factors contribute to uncertainties in the age determination. The frequency of measured equivalent doses reveals a large scattering. Optical bleaching of certain grains can be partial due to the short duration of the exposure to light. We worked with the single grain technique in order to find and select the grains that were sufficiently exposed to daylight. To determine the average equivalent dose, we tried three different approaches: a calculation of an arithmetic mean and one following either the central age model or the 3-parameter minimum age model, the latter turned out to be the only relevant way to evaluate the experimental data. The proportion of grains included in the calculation of the average equivalent dose represents 2.7â4.7 % of the overall analysed grains. The results obtained for the three out of four samples are approaching the expected age, however, the minimum doses and the corresponding ages are significantly over-estimated in case of two samples. The studied material is very coarse, which causes heterogeneity of irradiation at the single grain scale, and contributes to a dispersion of equivalent doses. Different analytical methods (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy cartography, Beta-radiography imaging, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) were employed to demonstrate the presence of this phenomenon. Despite the extremely large proportion of high equivalent doses in equivalent dose distributions, there is an apparent presence of well-bleached grains at the beginning of equivalent dose distributions. The study shows the potential of dating mortars by single grain OSL. },

The front wall and back wall of the chamber were made of graphite and Plexiglas respectively, as opposed to the one type of material in commercially available chambers. The collecting electrode has a diameter of 20Â mm. The sensitive volume is 0.63Â cm3. It was found that the Leakage current, the short-term stability and the polarity effect were within the international recommendations. The results were compared with those of a reference cylindrical chamber. The maximum difference observed in this comparison was 1.1%. The relative uncertainty was below 0.2%. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulation was undertaken using \{MCNP4C\} code and the relative difference of 1.9% was observed compared to the experiment. As a result the chamber presented a satisfactory performance in all evaluated tests in Gamma radiation field of 60Co. },

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to develop a microscopy-based foci quantification protocol in human lymphocyte capable of supplying useful data for radiation sensitivity assays. Human peripheral blood was exposed to gamma-rays and isolated lymphocytes were stained with fluorochrome-coupled anti-gamma-H2AX (Histone 2AX phosphorylation of serine 139) antibodies. Microscopy slides were automatically acquired and the resulting images were subjected to 3 focus scoring methods: manual, semi-automated and fully automated. All scoring methods were sufficiently sensitive to detect an irradiation of at least 0.05Â Gy with low variation between experiments. For higher doses, both automated approaches tend to detect fewer foci than manual scoring but still obtaining a linear correlation (lowest r2Â &gt;Â 0.971). Compared with manual scoring on the images, the automated approaches are at least 5 times faster with minimum operator intervention needed. We can conclude that our method is able to obtain the foci score of a blood sample in less than 6Â h. In addition to the foci score the programs used perform several cell and foci measurements of potential biological importance. },

  Abstract                 = {Colony formation as measured by the in vitro clonogenic assay is a very important endpoint to determine cellular radiosensitivity and tumor response to radiotherapy. In the framework of assessing in vitro cellular radiosensitivity, proliferation assays could represent an attractive alternative to the clonogenic assay for cell lines that do not form proper colonies. In the present study, we compared cellular radiosensitivity measurements obtained by the crystal violet (CV) cell proliferation assay and the standard colony formation assay in repair-deficient and-proficient human \{MCF10A\} cell lines. Compared to the clonogenic assay, the \{CV\} cell proliferation assay yielded higher surviving fractions for the same radiation dose. This is reflected in larger mean inactivation dose values â a parameter that reflects the area under the survival curve. However, as the dose modifying factors obtained by both assays are comparable, the \{CV\} cell proliferation assay can be used to compare the in vitro cellular radiosensitivity of cell lines that lack the ability to form well-defined colonies. },

Special attention was given to the measurement of the doses to the eye lenses. In this paper an overview will be given of the measured eye lens doses and the main influence factors for these doses. The measured eye lens doses are extrapolated to annual doses. The extrapolations showed that monitoring of the eye lens should be performed on routine basis. },

Radiation detriment from exposure of both radiological staff and other individuals is considered as part of the justification of medical exposures and of the optimization process. \{ICRP\} advises on the uncertainty concerning the risk of cataracts and puts particular emphasis on optimization in situations of exposure of the eyes. Some recommendations on staff protection are included in the documents on computed tomography, digital radiology, pregnancy, discharge of patients after therapy and interventional radiology. The contents related to staff \{RP\} in the coming publications of the Committee (pediatric, cardiology, and fluoroscopy) are also summarized. },

  Abstract                 = {Occupational dosimetry is still a challenge in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Personal dosimeters are not regularly used by many professionals. Most of the dosimeters used are worn under the lead apron and it is difficult to estimate radiation doses to the unprotected organs and tissues. New electronic dosimeters make it possible to know staff doses and dose rates in real time, inside interventional laboratories. A system using solid-state detectors and equipped with a wireless connection (DoseAware distributed by Philips) that sends the scatter dose rate and cumulative scatter dose readings to a base station, inside the catheterization room, has been evaluated. The initial test was carried out over a period of 4 months in two laboratories (a cardiology one and a second one dedicated to general interventional procedures). In addition to the educational value of the dosimetry system, other benefits have been identified such as the detailed information on occupational dose rate during the procedures, the possibility of comparing occupational doses registered among different staff during the procedures, the capability of establishing correlations between occupational and patient doses, and correlations between staff doses and geometry and radiographic factors used during the procedures. From all this information, it is possible to derive criteria for optimization of occupational radiation protection. },

Initial sensitivity changes were observed to influence the ability to measure a given dose. They are shown to depend on preheat temperature, bleaching procedure and size of the given dose. An apparent influence of the preheat temperature on equivalent dose and fading corrected ages is documented through thermal stability experiments. These suggest that, in the absence of a sufficiently high preheat treatment, thermally unstable components contribute to the \{IRSL\} signal leading to significant age underestimation. When a high preheat temperature is used (250Â Â°C for 60Â s), the age results are in good agreement with previously obtained quartz-OSL ages for material deposited during the last glacial period. However, this agreement may be caused by initial sensitivity changes and limitations of the fading correction. },

The threshold voltage (VT) of the pMOSFETs is measured using a âone-pointâ method that determines \{VT\} as the gate voltage for a given drain current. Using VT, the absorbed dose, which is directly proportional to the threshold voltage shift, is calculated. The reader is based on a low cost 8-bit \{PIC\} 18F4520 microcontroller (MCU), and works independently of a personal computer, uses a touch screen and stores the data in microcontroller memory. Good agreement in threshold voltage values, obtained using a high-quality source-measure unit and the reader, was obtained. In addition, the reader can be used for threshold voltage measurement with other types of MOSFETs, especially in long duration experiments, as well as for the real-time measurements in radiotherapy, either as an autonomous system or integrated in a larger monitoring configuration. },

  Abstract                 = {The depth-dose-profile and the transversal beam profile of a 6Â MV photon beam are measured by means of Eu-doped silica optical fibres. In both cases, a non-negligible influence of the stem effect was observed as consequence of the change in the relative contribution of the Cerenkov light while varying the vertical and lateral position of the fibre. The approach for removing the spurious luminescence signal based on the radioluminescence (RL) spectral analysis proved to be effective and independent of the irradiation configurations. },

It represents a preliminary study about the suitability of cotton as a marker of exposure in a radiation accident scenario. Cotton is indeed the most common material among clothing fabrics and a remarkably pure fibre. Moreover, it would allow âto mapâ the absorbed dose in different parts of the body. To investigate the signals specifically induced by ionizing radiation, we optimized \{EPR\} parameters and characterized time dependence of signals at high doses (500Â Gy). Then, to evaluate the contribution of the pre-irradiation signal on the radiation specific signals, we also performed \{EPR\} measurements on samples irradiated to 50Â Gy and 10Â Gy. Results highlighted the presence of typical features in the post-irradiation signal distinguishable from the pre-irradiation signal at all the investigated doses. In particular, one feature was identified and discussed as a possible marker of exposure. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Strong thermal quenching is observed from 77 to 550Â K in the far-red luminescence of K-feldspars. This far-red emission, next to the emission in the UV-to-blue spectrum recorded for thermoluminescence (TL), is reported in most alkaline feldspars with a characteristic peak centered on 710Â nm with a width of 100Â nm. This emission was observed by cathodoluminescence (CL) at room temperature (RT) for more than 30Â K-feldspars, ranging from volcanic sanidines to granitic microclines and sediments and it is attributed to an Fe3+ impurity. Contrary to âblueâ emission in volcanic feldspars, the far-red emission displays very low anomalous fading (AF). This makes it attractive for dating purposes; however, it has weak natural \{TL\} intensity, even at saturation, which competes with the black-body emission of the heater plate. This is in contrast to an intense tunneling afterglow at liquid nitrogen temperature (LNT). Further observations show that the disadvantage of weak \{TL\} can be overcome. Photoluminescence (PL) under \{UV\} shows a very strong thermal quenching effect of the far-red emission from 77 to 550Â K, which accounts for the above contrast. Near the LNT, the far-red Fe3+ photoluminescence is at a maximum and is dominant over other emissions in the spectrum. However, as the temperature increases, the efficiency decreases, falling to well below one percent, whereas the âblueâ emissions remain stable. This thermal quenching effect in photoluminescence is paralleled in TL. After irradiation and during storage at RT, whereas the âblueâ emission in volcanic feldspars is affected by âfastâ anomalous fading, charge trapped at Fe3+ centers as latent far-red emission is almost stable. As the \{TL\} evolves and the extant âblueâ emission is emitted, more and more of the trapped charge associated with far-red emission recombines non-radiatively, resulting in an efficiency for emission in natural \{TL\} that is less than one percent. A modified band model, which calls for 'hopping' conductivity during the storage, accounts for the anomalous fading. Trap emptying at lower temperatures should lead to better use of the stable latent far-red stored charge for the dating of volcanic deposits. },

The database âToothâ of the Urals Research Center for Radiation Medicine (URCRM) has accumulated about 1000 \{EPR\} measurements of tooth enamel from the rural population of the Urals region. The teeth were investigated by laboratories of Russia, USA, Germany and Italy. Most of the enamel samples were measured several times in different laboratories. Each laboratory used different equipment and its own methods for sampleÂ preparation and \{EPR\} spectra analysis. Even measurements performed at the same laboratory over 10â15 years may not be assumed as uniform: methods change with time, and equipment is subject to aging. These two factors influenced \{EPR\} performance. The purpose of this study is, therefore, the harmonization of \{EPR\} data accumulated during long-term dosimetric investigations in the Southern Urals for further pooled analysis.

Our test results suggest that the current Time Temperature Profile (TTP) with a maximum temperature of 260Â Â°C overheats DT-702/PDâs thinnest chip 3 causing 29%Â Â±Â 7.4% loss in sensitivity over 1000 cycles. For the other three elements, it is significantly less. A possible cause of this effect is overheating of element 3. Our results indicate that one possible solution is to modify \{TTP\} for all chips and decouple the \{TTP\} for chip 3. There is also significant variability ranging from 22% to 40% between different TLDâs and 8%â22% for different readers. Calibration cards undergo the highest number of heats and irradiation cycles because they are used to calibrate TLDâs and readers. The stability of calibration cardâs sensitivity is critical to provide accurate dose of record. Any change in the calibration card element correction coefficient (ecc) is reflected immediately in calibration of other TLDâs and readers. A variety of processes have been implemented to control sensitivity of calibration cards. Proficiency and intercomparison results support the current operating policy and procedures to protect the accuracy and efficiency of our personnel dose program. Suggested \{TTP\} modification may reduce the loss of sensitivity for and may extend the life of calibration TLDâs to over 1000 heat cycles. },

  Abstract                 = {Lithium formate and l-Î±-alanine (alanine) \{EPR\} dosimeters were irradiated to doses from 100Â Gy to 100Â kGy. The irradiations were mainly performed at a Gammacell irradiator with dose rate of approximately 5.5Â kGyÂ hâ1. Both the peak-to-peak amplitude of the first derivative \{EPR\} spectrum and the area under the \{EPR\} absorption spectrum were extracted, and the resulting dose dependence of these \{EPR\} signal intensity parameters was analyzed. The dependence of the peak-to-peak width of the central resonance in the first derivative \{EPR\} spectrum on the dose was also elucidated. In addition, the dependence on dose rate and irradiation temperature for the two materials were measured. Dosimeters were given doses from 100Â Gy to 10Â kGy at two different Gammacells with dose rates of 5.5Â kGyÂ hâ1 and 0.6Â kGyÂ hâ1, respectively, and the results were compared. Furthermore, the \{EPR\} signal intensities for dosimeters irradiated to 1Â kGy at temperatures from 11Â Â°C to 40Â Â°C were analyzed. By fitting an âexponential rise to maximumâ-function to the dependence of the area under the \{EPR\} absorption spectrum on the dose, saturation doses of 53Â kGy and 87Â kGy for lithium formate and alanine, respectively, were found. Lower estimates were found when analyzing the dose dependence of the peak-to-peak amplitude. Furthermore, the peak-to-peak width was found to increase for doses above 10Â kGy. No dose rate dependence for any of the studied materials was observed and the temperature coefficients at 25Â Â°C (i.e. change in dosimeter signal per Â°C change in irradiation temperature) were 0.154%Â Kâ1 and 0.161%Â Kâ1 for lithium formate and alanine, respectively. This work demonstrates that lithium formate \{EPR\} dosimeters may be suitable for high dose applications, but their signals saturate at lower doses than alanine. The saturation doses found for both materials may be used in theoretical calculations of the dosimeter response following hadron beam irradiations. },

  Abstract                 = {The dose-to-water energy dependence may be defined as the dosimeter reading per absorbed dose to water for a given radiation beam relative to that for 60Co Î³ rays. The purpose of this work was to review the literature on the dose-to-water energy dependence of lithium formate and alanine \{EPR\} dosimeters and LiF:Mg,Ti TL-dosimeters for clinical beam qualities and to compare the findings with Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo simulations of the energy dependence of lithium formate and alanine \{EPR\} dosimeters and LiF:Mg,Ti TL-dosimeters were performed using the \{EGSnrc\} code. The following common clinical radiation qualities were applied: 4â24 \{MV\} photons, 4â20 MeV electrons, 50â200 kVp X-rays, 192Ir Î³ rays, and 60Co Î³ rays as the reference. All dosimeter materials showed measured and Monte Carlo simulated energy responses around unity for \{MV\} photons, electrons and 192Ir Î³ rays, except LiF TL-dosimeters which showed an average underresponse of approximately 3% for electrons. For medium energy X-rays (50â200 kVp), LiF displayed an increasing overresponse with decreasing energy to a maximum of about 40% for 50 kVp X-rays. The two \{EPR\} dosimeter materials showed decreasing energy response with decreasing X-ray energy, but lithium formate was less dependent on energy than alanine. Comparisons between Monte Carlo simulations and measurements revealed some deviations for medium energy X-rays, which may be due to LET-effects caused by low energy electrons. In conclusion, lithium formate is the dosimeter material with the lowest energy dependence over a wide range of clinically relevant radiation qualities, which clearly is advantageous for accurate dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {The present study is proposed to investigate temporal variations of soilâgas composition in the vicinity of different fault zones in Taiwan. To carry out the investigations, variations of soilâgases compositions were measured at continuous earthquake monitoring stations along Hsincheng and Hsinhua faults in Hsinchu and Tainan areas, respectively. Before selecting a monitoring site, the occurrence of deeper gas emanation was investigated by the soilâgas surveys and followed by continuous monitoring of some selected sites with respect to tectonic activity to check the sensitivity of the sites. Based on the results of long term geochemical monitoring at the established monitoring stations we can divide the studied area in two different tectonic zones. We proposed tectonic based model for earthquake forecasting in Taiwan and tested it for some big earthquakes occurred during observation period i.e. 2009â2010. Based on the anomalous signatures from particular monitoring stations we are in a state to identify the area for impending earthquakes of magnitude â¥5 and we have tested it for some earthquakes which rocked the country during that period. It can be concluded from above results that the stress/strain transmission for a particular earthquake is hindered by different tectonic settings of the region under study. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Evaluation of radiation dose is very important for the detection of radiation damage. Î³-H2AX is a popular biological dosimeter to evaluate the radiation effect. Typically, bulky and expensive commercial flow cytometers are used to detect Î³-H2AX. This paper presents a miniaturized and high sensitive cytometer using a microfluidic chip for evaluating the radiation dose by detecting the mean immunofluorescence intensity of Î³-H2AX. A compact optical focusing system and a shift-phase differential amplifier are designed to improve the detection sensitivity. Sample lymphocyte cells are stained by \{FITC\} fluorescent dye after being irradiated by UVC. Comparison experiments between the developed miniature cytometer and a commercial flow cytometer were conducted under different radiation doses. The developed microfluidic cytometer also demonstrates a good linear correlation between the measured fluorescence intensity and the irradiation dose with a detection limit similar to that of the commercial flow cytometer. The developed cytometer can evaluate quantitatively the radiation dose by the mean fluorescence intensity of Î³-H2AX with a significantly smaller amount of blood samples than a commercial flow cytometer. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The spatial variation of soil gas radon values were correlated with the seismogenic faults and earthquakes in the Tangshan area (north China). Radon concentrations were measured at 756 sites in an area about 2500Â km2 from April to May 2010. The background and anomaly threshold values calculated were 4730.4Â Bq/m3 and 8294.1Â Bq/m3, respectively. Radon concentrations highlight a decreasing gradient from \{NE\} to \{SW\} in the area. Higher values mostly distributed in the \{NE\} sector of the Tangshan fault and the Luanxian fault where the Tangshan (Ms 7.8), and Luanxian (MS 7.1) earthquakes occurred in 1976 and 17 earthquakes with MSÂ =Â 3.0 occurred in this area since 2005. Radon values illustrated a close relation with the shallow fault trace and earthquake activity in the area. The active fault zones and the associated fractures formed by the larger earthquakes, act as paths for radon migration. },

  Abstract                 = {Using a museum specimen of perthitic feldspar, the characteristics of post-IR \{IRSL\} production at 200Â Â°C after different prior \{IR\} bleaching at 100Â Â°C were investigated. It was found that the post-IR \{IRSL\} signal had an isothermal \{TL\} contribution that was unexpected following a previous preheat at 320Â Â°C; this is the result of isothermal decay of recuperated \{TL\} peaks resulting from photo-transfer that occurred when the previous \{IRSL\} signal was measured at a lower temperature. The isothermal \{TL\} contribution to the post-IR \{IRSL\} signal depends on prior \{IR\} bleaching conditions. Since the recuperated \{TL\} signal comes from photo-transfer during \{IRSL\} production, this signal should also suffer from anomalous fading. Thus, it is suggested that this isothermal \{TL\} contribution to the measured post-IR \{IRSL\} is removed by the inclusion of an additional step, a cut-heat to 300Â Â°C, in the post-IR \{IRSL\} dating protocol. },

  Abstract                 = {When using a single-aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol for luminescence dating of sedimentary quartz grains, the fundamental assumption is that the sensitivity of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) produced by the regenerative doses can be monitored by their following test dose \{OSL\} response. Using well-bleached coarse quartz grains, \{OSL\} production in a \{SAR\} protocol was studied in detail when dose response curves were constructed using both single and multiple aliquot regenerative dose procedures. During application of the \{SAR\} protocol, two preheats are applied, each ahead of an \{OSL\} measurement that is produced by the regenerative dose and test dose, respectively. It is shown that sensitivity changes caused by heating were well corrected for using the \{OSL\} response to the test dose. However, these preheats are shown to result in thermally stimulated \{OSL\} signals that contribute both to the \{OSL\} response from the regenerative doses used to construct the dose response curve and to the \{OSL\} response from the test dose used to monitor \{OSL\} sensitivity changes as the quartz grains are repeatedly measured. A simple test is proposed to identify the contribution of the latter signal. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A museum sample of perthitic feldspar was used to study the production of post-IR \{IRSL\} signals. It was found that traps responsible for low temperature (â¼230Â Â°C) \{TL\} peaks play an unexpectedly important role in post-IR \{IRSL\} production. During the production of the \{IRSL\} signal during low temperature \{IR\} stimulation (100Â Â°C), electrons are optically transferred from \{IRSL\} traps into these \{TL\} traps which have been emptied by the preceding preheat at 320Â Â°C. Subsequent heating to 300Â Â°C causes thermal transfer of these electrons from these traps back into previously emptied \{IRSL\} traps which are related to the high temperature \{TL\} peaks. \{IR\} stimulation of these electrons results in post-IR IRSL. Thus the initial source of the post-IR \{IRSL\} signal is the same as the \{IRSL\} signal, with a role being played by intermediate traps that give rise to \{TL\} signals between 200 and 250Â Â°C, and the final source is similar to that of the \{IRSL\} signal. Therefore the post-IR \{IRSL\} signal is a by-product of the production of the \{IRSL\} signal. It was also found that post-IR \{IRSL\} production with high post-IR \{IR\} stimulation temperatures (e.g. &gt;230Â Â°C) additionally includes a small contribution from the post-IR isothermal decay of high temperature \{TL\} peaks that are not sensitive to \{IR\} stimulation at low stimulation temperatures. },

Optical bleaching prior to giving a 9.35Â Gy dose in the laboratory was carried out using artificial light sources, namely blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a solar simulator, followed by more than 24Â h storage at room temperature. Stimulating the quartz with blue \{LEDs\} at room temperature resulted in overestimation of the recovered dose, whereas using the same stimulation time at temperatures above 150Â Â°C resulted in the correct value for the recovered dose. Exposure to the solar simulator for times less than 200Â min resulted in overestimation of the dose, whereas progressive underestimation was found for longer bleaching times. When doses of up 5333Â Gy were given ahead of a 200Â min exposure to the solar simulator, the dose recovered depended upon the magnitude of the previous dose, thus questioning the general application of a simple dose recovery experiment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this work mechanoluminescence and lyoluminescence properties of Li2BaP2O7: Eu phosphor are reported. Phosphor was synthesized through high temperature solid state diffusion method. Analysis of phosphor was made through various characterization techniques such as mechanoluminescence (ML), lyoluminescence (LL), x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and photoluminescence (PL). It was observed that \{ML\} intensity showed good enhancement with variation in time, concentration of dopant Eu, mass of piston and impact velocity. Lyoluminescence intensity was also found to increase with change in time and mass of the sample. Variation in gamma doses imparted to Li2BaP2O7: Eu phosphor was observed to affect both the \{ML\} and \{LL\} intensities' respectively. Both the \{ML\} and \{LL\} intensity attain a maximum value Im at a particular time tm but afterwards, it decreases and finally disappears. Morphology of Li2BaP2O7: Eu luminescent material was also studied using scanning electron microscope technique. The average particle size in Eu doped lithium barium diphosphate phosphor was around 2Â Î¼m. },

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a novel micro-size dosimeter using an optical fiber probe coupled with a photostimulable storage phosphor, such as BaFBr:Eu2+. Our micro-size dosimeter is based on the concept in which the radiation dose response is temporally compressed by using integrating-type dosimeter elements, such as a photostimulable storage phosphor, and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved to downsize the dosimeter probe. We fabricate the prototype dosimeter probe which has the detectable volume of 100Â Î¼m thick and 400Â Î¼m diameter and the outer diameter of 900Â Î¼m. The lower limit of detectable dose, which is defined as three times the noise level, is evaluated to be 0.9Â mGy. This value is much smaller than the typical irradiation dose (a few Gy per treatment) in the radiotherapy. We, therefore, conclude that the proposed micro-size dosimeter can be a promising candidate of in-vivo and on-line dose monitor in the radiotherapy. },

A simple design was implemented, incorporating a movable eye plaque in a small water phantom above the silicon Medipix2 detector. It is designed for obtaining 2D dose distributions at different depths in water, for subsequent 3D dose mapping. The effect of backscattering in a medium placed behind the Medipix2 to simulate surrounding tissue has been studied in terms of dose distribution. Additionally, two modes of acquisition, event counting mode and the more complex time-over-threshold mode, were compared to the TG-43 protocol for the determination of their suitability for dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The space radiation environment is composed of energetic particles which can deliver harmful doses of radiation that may lead to acute radiation sickness, cancer, and even death for insufficiently shielded crew members. Spacecraft shielding must provide structural integrity and minimize the risk associated with radiation exposure. The risk of radiation exposure induced death (REID) is a measure of the risk of dying from cancer induced by radiation exposure. Uncertainties in the risk projection model, quality factor, and spectral fluence are folded into the calculation of the \{REID\} by sampling from probability distribution functions. Consequently, determining optimal shielding materials that reduce the \{REID\} in a statistically significant manner has been found to be difficult. In this work, the difference of the \{REID\} distributions for different materials is used to study the effect of composition on shielding effectiveness. It is shown that the use of correlated uncertainties allows for the determination of statistically significant differences between materials despite the large uncertainties in the quality factor. This is in contrast to previous methods where uncertainties have been generally treated as uncorrelated. It is concluded that the use of correlated quality factor uncertainties greatly reduces the uncertainty in the assessment of shielding effectiveness for the mitigation of radiation exposure. },

  Abstract                 = {Samples from plutonic geological settings emit strong and stable UV, blue and red luminescence. These samples provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of luminescence emissions by comparing their origin, intensity, trapping and recombination characteristics. In addition, the De derived from certain techniques can be used to investigate De consistency. Thus, \{UV\} and red signals emitted by the same sample of grantic quartz have been compared according to the strength and shape of the emissions, response to annealing and dose, growth characteristics and the resulting De derived from single-aliquot regeneration (SAR â \{UV\} emissions) and the dual-aliquot protocol for red \{TL\} (DAP â red emissions). This comparison of \{UV\} and red De values can be used as an alternative measure of accuracy for depositional situations where independent age control is not available. Furthermore, this comparison has been extended to a single-grain level to determine if \{UV\} and red signals are emitted by the same quartz grain. The resulting comparisons demonstrate that both signals are strong, reproducible, are suitable for dating, and a comparison of De is a valid internal check of consistency. The single-grain analysis demonstrates that the grains contain \{UV\} and red recombination centres rather than the typical characteristics of just beta or alpha quartz. Thus it has been suggested that the emissions relate to post-origin modifications of the signal rather than its thermal origin. This type of comparative analysis provides clues as to the source and evolution of the signals, provides a greater understanding of the complexities of the luminescence signal and a possible solution for accuracy testing in challenging depositional contexts. },

  Abstract                 = {The nuclear workers of the Mayak Production Association had regular check-ups including medical diagnostic X-ray examinations since start of the production lines in 1948. Doses from diagnostic examinations need to be considered in reconstruction of occupational doses of the workers with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of tooth enamel. The numbers and types of examinations of an individual worker can be assessed from the Mayak \{PA\} archives but no information was available on doses delivered to teeth by a single specific examination. Of the twenty one applied examination procedures only three affected the teeth, these being X-ray examinations of teeth, skull and cervical spine. For these three kinds of examinations operational procedures and operating modes of X-ray units were compiled from the archive and photon spectra were obtained from a catalog of spectral data for diagnostic X-rays. Entrance doses in air kerma were calculated using the fluence of photon spectra and absorbed dose in tooth enamel for various tooth positions and exposure geometry was then calculated using dose conversion coefficients obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. Doses were calculated for examinations in 1948â2000. Except for examination of the skull, absorbed doses in enamel of incisors were found to be about twice as large as in enamel of molars. In the period before 1970 the largest mean absorbed doses in tooth enamel were due to X-ray examination of teeth, with 64Â mGy and 34Â mGy calculated for incisors and molars, respectively. In the same period the lowest mean doses were due to X-ray examination of the skull, with 11Â mGy and 12Â mGy calculated for incisors and molars, respectively. In the period from 1970 to 2000, largest mean doses in enamel were due to X-ray examination of cervical spine, with 23Â mGy and 12Â mGy calculated for incisors and molars, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {Biological dosimetry is an essential tool for estimating radiation doses received to personnel when physical dosimetry is not available or inadequate. The current preferred biodosimetry method is based on the measurement of radiation-specific dicentric chromosomes in exposed individualsâ peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, this method is labor-, time- and expertise-demanding. Consequently, for mass casualty applications, strategies have been developed to increase its throughput. One such strategy is to develop validated cytogenetic biodosimetry laboratory networks, both national and international. In a previous study, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) was validated in our cytogenetic biodosimetry network involving five geographically dispersed laboratories. A complementary strategy to further enhance the throughput of the \{DCA\} among inter-laboratory networks is to use a triage \{DCA\} where dose assessments are made by truncating the labor-demanding and time-consuming metaphase spread analysis to 20 â 50 metaphase spreads instead of routine 500 â 1000 metaphase spread analysis. Our laboratory network also validated this triage DCA, however, these dose estimates were made using calibration curves generated in each laboratory from the blood samples irradiated in a single laboratory. In an emergency situation, dose estimates made using pre-existing calibration curves which may vary according to radiation type and dose rate and therefore influence the assessed dose. Here, we analyze the effect of using a pre-existing calibration curve on assessed dose among our network laboratories. The dose estimates were made by analyzing 1000 metaphase spreads as well as triage quality scoring and compared to actual physical doses applied to the samples for validation. The dose estimates in the laboratory partners were in good agreement with the applied physical doses and determined to be adequate for guidance in the treatment of acute radiation syndrome. },

  Abstract                 = {In order to meet the potential need for emergency large-scale retrospective radiation biodosimetry following an accident or attack, we have developed instrumentation and methodology for in vivo electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify concentrations of radiation-induced radicals within intact teeth. This technique has several very desirable characteristics for triage, including independence from confounding biologic factors, a non-invasive measurement procedure, the capability to make measurements at any time after the event, suitability for use by non-expert operators at the site of an event, and the ability to provide immediate estimates of individual doses. Throughout development there has been a particular focus on the need for a deployable system, including instrumental requirements for transport and field use, the need for high throughput, and use by minimally trained operators. Numerous measurements have been performed using this system in clinical and other non-laboratory settings, including in vivo measurements with unexposed populations as well as patients undergoing radiation therapies. The collection and analyses of sets of three serially-acquired spectra with independent placements of the resonator, in a data collection process lasting approximately 5Â min, provides dose estimates with standard errors of prediction of approximately 1Â Gy. As an example, measurements were performed on incisor teeth of subjects who had either received no irradiation or 2Â Gy total body irradiation for prior bone marrow transplantation; this exercise provided a direct and challenging test of our capability to identify subjects who would be in need of acute medical care. },

  Abstract                 = {A portable fiber optic dosimeter has been developed that incorporates RbMgF3:Eu2+ at the end of a multimode polymer fiber. It uses two stimulation sources and takes advantage of the range of stimulable traps in this compound. We observe radioluminescence (RL) during gamma ray irradiation and show that the low-dose \{RL\} increases linearly with increasing dose rate where the minimum detectible dose rate is â¼0.015 Î¼Sv/s. We show that pulsed infrared-stimulated (940Â nm) optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) can be used for real time dose monitoring. The cumulative dose can be readout after irradiation where a linear \{OSL\} dose response was observed when stimulating at 505Â nm and the minimum detectable dose is â¼50 Î¼Sv. },

We have measured time resolved emissions from the minor site Pr3+ in (Ba,La)F2:Pr at 10 and 300Â K. The spectra clearly show the 1S0 emission from the Pr3+ ions in some low symmetry Pr-sites (we designate them La-sites) previously identified in higher concentration (0.3Â m%Pr and more) crystals. However most of emission from the Pr activated (Ba,La)F2 crystals originates in Pr3+ ions in other sites which produce an efficient d-f emission. As demonstrated by excitation spectra, the emission from some of these sites (denoted as Ba-sites) closely resembles the d-f emission from BaF2. The La-site, time resolved and long delay emission spectra are dominated by hypersensitive transitions from the 1S0 and 3P0 levels to lower energy levels of the 4f2 configurations. Only these transitions contribute to the photon cascade emission desired for some mercury free phosphor applications. },

A suitable casing of black Perspex has been developed to give a sufficiently accurate estimate of the air kerma value at the detector position.

Investigations on the optical and thermal properties of the Al center in our samples show, that these properties are determined by one or several unknown electron traps. \{ESR\} ages using the Al center show good agreement with independent ages up to 500 ka, but also show that the thermal stability can vary significantly from sample to sample. Age overestimation due to incomplete resetting of the \{ESR\} signals at the time of eruption is found for two samples and weak or non-existent Eâ and \{OHC\} signals are discussed as possible indicators of complete zeroing. },

The cumulative doses measured with \{TL\} were found to be continuously lower (on average 10â20%) than the ones measured with \{OSL\} for the same sample and using the same luminescence reader. From dose recovery tests, laboratory kinetic analysis and available meteorological parameters of the sample site for the past 100 years, it is concluded that the most likely reason for the discrepancy is thermal fading of the 210 Â°C \{TL\} peak. By applying a suitable model, an effective lifetime of the electron trap of the 210 Â°C \{TL\} peak of 200â700 years is estimated for the moderate continental climate at the sample site. It is concluded that for samples in regions of continental climate and directly exposed to sunlight, dose measurements using the 210 Â°C \{TL\} peak should be restricted to the last 50â60 years. Applications to older samples should only be considered if bricks are not directly exposed to sunlight or if the background dose is small compared to the anthropogenic dose, as the latter will have been acquired during shorter times and will thus not have been subjected to significant thermal fading. },

Previous works [GÃ¶ksu etÂ al., 2002. First international intercomparison of luminescence techniques using samples from the Techa river valley. Health Phys. 82, 94â101] have shown that the expected dose due to man-made sources of radiation in the bricks is in the same range as the background dose due to natural sources of radiation, therefore a precise estimate of the cumulative and background dose is of utmost importance. Cumulative doses could be assessed with \{OSL\} with a precision of around 4% and lie between 450 and 600 mGy. The background dose was carefully determined by a combination of laboratory measurements, in-situ gamma spectrometry and Monte Carlo modelling. The results show that the gamma-dose rate of the soil was overestimated and the fractional brick gamma-dose rate underestimated in previous studies, but that the overall gamma-dose rate was nearly correct, due to mutual compensation. The obtained anthropogenic doses in brick measured with \{OSL\} lie between 200 and 300 mGy, show variability between adjacent bricks within error limits for one spot but a significant difference for two samples is observed for another spot. A distinct dependency of measured dose upon sample height is observed, which is an indication of a source distribution, which extends over a large area and up to a certain depth into the soil and in which higher contaminated areas are located at a greater distance to the mill than lower contaminated areas. A measured doseâdepth profile is compared with previously published Monte Carlo calculations to verify the source energy. },

  Abstract                 = {High energy physics (HEP) experiments and research gave rise to the development of high spatial resolution tracking vertex detectors and the accompanying data acquisition systems (DAQ) capable of high temporal resolution measurements. The technology translation from \{HEP\} to the day to day medical radiation dosimetry is gradual but certain. This paper discusses the design and development of a high spatial resolution (0.2Â mm pitch) silicon strip detector referred to as the Dose Magnifying Glass designed and prototyped by the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP), University of Wollongong. The \{DMG\} has 128 phosphor implanted n+ strips on a p-type silicon wafer coupled to a \{TERA\} readout system. The preirradiated low resistivity device was found to be dose rate independent (1.1%) for the dose rate of 9.45Â ÃÂ 10â5 to 2.72Â ÃÂ 10â4Â Gy/pulse. The effect of detector packaging was studied. The application of \{DMG\} in small field dosimetry was demonstrated in the real time measurement of stereotactic radiosurgery cone profiles and the imaging of 125I brachytherapy seeds. The DMG, a concept once started in the \{HEP\} experiments, now offers new possibilities in medical radiation dosimetry. },

  Abstract                 = {In this work we present the design of a chip which provides the readout of a highly segmented diode array, in which signals induced by individual X-ray photons are processed discretely. There are several benefits to this approach, including the ability to achieve a high signal to noise ratio due to the inherently low sensor capacitance, and the suppression of background noise (e.g. dark current) using an analogue threshold. The segmentation also ensures a linear behaviour even at very high dose rates. A time over threshold (ToT11ToT: Time over threshold. ASIC: Application-specific integrated circuit. APS: Active pixel sensor. DAC: Digital to analogue convertor. CSA: Charge sensitive preamplifier. ENC: Equivalent noise charge. ) energy measurement technique provides an immediate digital value corresponding to the energy deposited onto the diode by each individual photon. Deadtime-free operation is achieved by reading out a subset of the detector segments at a time while the rest of the detector continues to process signals. This paper describes the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip which was designed to provide pre-processing of photo-induced signals in the detector and readout of the processed digital data. },

A constant trap depth supports this phenomenon. Further, the decay curve of the afterglow and the change in initial trapped carrier concentration can be fitted using general-order kinetics and the fitting results show that the afterglow is close to a second-order kinetics process, which implies that most of the released carriers are retrapped. },

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Beam hardening effects due to photons passing through the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) frequently exist in Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) fields. A fast online dose transmission verification system, \{MBMC\} (Measurement Based Monte Carlo), can verify \{IMRT\} delivery by using a fluence efficiency map to replace \{MLC\} geometry and movement simulation. This system, however, ignores beam hardening effects, and assumes that dose disturbances through the \{MLC\} are not significant for \{IMRT\} fields. This assumption has to be justified before it can be applied in the clinic. Methods In this study, we simulated several field sizes (0.5Â ÃÂ 0.5, 1Â ÃÂ 1, 3Â ÃÂ 3, 5Â ÃÂ 5, and 10Â ÃÂ 10Â cm2) to evaluate the dose influence of beam hardening effects under clinical conditions. In addition, a \{LATCH\} technique was used during simulation processes, which can record each particle interaction with specific gantry components, to distinguish between dose contribution from the total beam and \{MLC\} mediated beam. Results The \{MLC\} indeed caused significant beam hardening effects, but the dose contribution fraction from the \{MLC\} was noticeable only for field sizes less than 1Â ÃÂ 1Â cm2. Furthermore, in mixed fields containing both the total beam and \{MLC\} mediated beam, the maximum dose deviation due to the presence of the \{MLC\} is small even for the 0.5Â ÃÂ 0.5Â cm2 field size (â¼2%). Conclusions The \{MLC\} causes noticeable beam hardening effects, but this effect results in only slight dose differences that are only noticeable for small field sizes in \{IMRT\} delivery. The use of a fluence efficiency map was feasible in our \{MBMC\} system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The mountain building processes in Taiwan are currently among the most rapid in the world. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of this orogen are still poorly resolved within the &lt;0.5 Ma timescale, reflecting methodological gaps in addressing young and rapid bedrock cooling by erosion. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) from quartz is an emerging thermochronometer that could potentially provide valuable low-temperature markers on a â¼0.1 Ma timescale. Here we study four meta-sandstone samples from the Hsuehshan Range in central Taiwan. We characterize the \{OSL\} from these samples in terms of feldspar contamination, saturation dose, signal components, and thermal stability. We conclude that the \{OSL\} is dominated by the fast component, and is therefore amenable to dose measurement using the \{SAR\} protocol. Based on the luminescence characteristics and ambient dose rate, we suggest that these samples may be valuable for evaluating recent cooling rates exceeding 360Â Â±Â 100Â Â°C/Ma, in places where the alternative thermal scenarios (instantaneous cooling or prolonged isothermal storage) may be ruled out by external geological constraints. },

  Abstract                 = {Both polymer gels and \{PRESAGE\} radiochromic plastic dosimeter, in conjunction with optical \{CT\} scanning system, have been employed to measure 3-D dose distributions in radiotherapy. The 3-D dose maps obtained from these systems can provide a useful tool for dose verification on complex treatments such as IMRT, radiosurgery, and RapidArc. These complex treatments present high dose gradient regions in the boundaries between the target and the surrounding critical organs. Dose accuracy in these areas can be critical, and may affect the treatment. There is a pressing need for a dosimeter that allows for accurate determination of 3-D dose distribution with high spatial resolution. In this review paper, clinical applications of polymer gels and \{PRESAGE\} dosimeter with optical \{CT\} scanning are presented. Dosimetric performance is evaluated in terms of their sensitivity calibration, irradiation, optimization of scanning procedures, precision, and accuracy. The results demonstrate that an accurate 3-D dose distribution with high resolution can be implemented. },

We have compared the performance of three algorithms for digital neutron/Î³ discrimination in a deuterated liquid scintillator. The effects of both digital filters and simulated pile-up events on the performance of these techniques were investigated. The discrimination methods utilized are the digital charge comparison (CC) method, simplified digital charge collection (SDCC) method and pulse gradient analysis (PGA) method. The results show that the \{SDCC\} and the \{CC\} methods are preferred choices when applied in low count-rates fields, whereas \{PGA\} method with a seven-point average running filter is favorable when pile-up signals constitute a large fraction of the detected events. All these discrimination approaches are potentially suitable for developing a compact digital neutron spectrometer in mixed neutron/Î³ radiation fields for use in various applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Cosmic-ray origin neutrons were measured with a scintillation detector at the summit of Mt. Fuji at an altitude of 3776Â m during the summer of 2008. The averaged neutron ambient dose equivalent rate converted from the count rates of the detector was 0.47Â Â±Â 0.001Â Î¼SvÂ hâ1, which is approximately four times greater than the calculated value of 0.11Â Â±Â 0.01Â Î¼SvÂ hâ1. It is postulated that the discrepancy between the measured and calculated neutron ambient dose equivalent rates is on account of the additional charged particle component of the mixed radiation field. To examine the characteristics of the detector at high altitude, a simple model equation which relates the count rates of the detector to the calculated fluence rates of cosmic radiation has been supposed. Based on the model equation it is estimated that the neutron ambient dose equivalent rate would be 0.14Â Â±Â 0.04Â Î¼SvÂ hâ1, and the proton contribution would be 0.28Â Â±Â 0.03Â Î¼SvÂ hâ1 converted as neutron ambient dose equivalent rate. The results agree to the values of the measured and calculated neutron dose equivalent rates, and the discrepancy between them within the errors. },

It has been established that the transition of Na-bound two halide exciton from singlet state causes 3Â eV emission of CsI:Na. The capturing of Vk by Na+Â ion determines the scintillation pulse shape. Thermal liberation of Vk from VkA centers results in an inertial rise of the emission pulse in lightly activated CsI:Na and in a mono-exponential decay of the emission pulse in heavily activated CsI:Na. The value of thermal dissociation energy of VkA centers is 0.24Â Â±Â 0.01Â eV, which was obtained from the temperature dependences of the emission decay time constant for CsI:2.8â10â3%Na and of the rise time constant for CsI:2.0â10â4%Na. },

  Abstract                 = {Background The aim of this study was to investigate patient doses in prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered \{CT\} coronary angiography (CTCA) combined with multi-segment reconstruction on a 320-detector-row CT. Methods \{CTCA\} data acquired with prospective \{ECG\} (pECG) triggering at 0â100% (pECG100%), 30â80% (pECG50%), 70â80% (pECG10%) of the RâR interval and reconstructed using mono-, two- and three-segment reconstruction were investigated. Effective doses were estimated by using LiF-TLDs placed at several organ sites in an Alderson-Rando phantom. Results With pECG100%, the estimation of effective dose of data reconstructed using mono-segment (pECG100%_1S) reconstruction was 10.01Â Â±Â 0.56Â mSv. For data acquired using pECG50%, the effective doses were 6.16Â Â±Â 0.12, 9.92Â Â±Â 0.37 and 13.51Â Â±Â 0.17Â mSv in mono-segment (pECG50%_1S), two-segment (pECG50%_2S) and three-segment (pECG50%_3S) reconstruction, respectively. The effective dose of data acquired with pECG10% and reconstructed using mono-segment (pECG10%_1S) reconstruction was 3.61Â Â±Â 0.07Â mSv. We observed a difference of around 7.46% between effective doses estimated using TLD-phantom measurement and \{CT\} dose index (CTDI) obtained from the scanner. Conclusion For patients with low and intermediate heart rate, radiation exposure could be reduced by 38.6% or more by narrowing pulsing window width. Although slightly higher radiation dose was observed in multi-segment reconstruction, this method can be used in high heart rate patients to provide data of high temporal resolution without increasing radiation exposure when it is combined with prospective \{ECG\} triggering. },

When the core configuration changed in June 2009, it became essential to re-determine such neutron flux parameters as thermal to epithermal neutron flux ratio (Æ), epithermal neutron flux shape factor (Î±), thermal neutron flux (Ïth) and epithermal neutron flux (Ïepi) in the irradiation positions of \{MNA\} research reactor in order to guarantee accuracy in the application of k0-neutron activation analysis (k0-NAA).The Æ and Î± were determined using the bare bi-isotopic monitor and bare triple monitor methods, respectively; Au and Zr monitors were utilized in present study. The results for four irradiation positions are presented and discussed in the present work. The calculated values of Æ and Î± ranged from 33.49 to 47.33 and â0.07 to â0.14, respectively. The Ïth and the Ïepi were measured as 2.03Â ÃÂ 1012Â (cmâ2Â sâ1) and 6.05Â ÃÂ 1010Â (cmâ2Â sâ1) respectively. These results were compared to those of previous studies at this reactor as well as to those of reactors in other countries. The results indicate a good conformity with other findings. },

  Abstract                 = {In this study, the various dosimetric properties of the thermoluminescent (TL) phosphor of CaF2:natural including response characteristics, sensitivity to thermal annealing and decay of stored energy were investigated in detail. The analysis of the peak temperature values and the half widths of the resolved components in the glow curves, by using the Computerized Glow Curve Deconvolution (CGCD) Method, resulted in the activation energy (E) of 0.85â1.83Â eV and frequency factor (s) of 6.17E+9â2.90E+15Â sâ1. The effects of pre-irradiation thermal annealing on the radiation-induced sensitization of the thermoluminescent response of CaF2:natural were presented. An enhancement of sensitivity after being subjected to a high beta particle exposure was clarified. The effect was complicated by the influence of heat treatments before the exposure to radiation. Replicate runs on CaF2:natural after irradiation with 1Â Gy absorbed dose indicated good reproducibility of peak temperatures and intensities; they can be re-used for repeated measurements. It appeared that the main dosimetric peak at 280Â Â°C exhibits negligible fading over 4 weeks and may be used for dosimetry. This study has demonstrated that the potential exists for the use of CaF2:natural for \{TL\} radiation dosimetry. },

Two kinds of 12 \{TLDs\} (thermoluminescent dosimeters) were randomly assigned to four groups, respectively. Each group of 3 \{TLDs\} was placed 5Â cm deep in the center of a 15-cm-thick solid water phantom within the measurement and four mAs settings were used for X-rays (56, 100, 200, 315Â mAs) and 64 \{MSCT\} (50, 100, 200, 400Â mAs). The linearity, reproducibility, sensitivity and the minimum detectable dose limit of various \{TLDs\} were obtained from dose calibration lines to verify the integrated performance according to the Taguchi's quality loss function. Both \{TLDs\} performed similarly when exposed to X-rays. The TLD-100T outperformed TLD-100H when exposed to 64 MSCT. The low reproducibility of TLD-100H could be eliminated by doubling the number of \{TLDs\} in one position to reduce the standard deviation of TLD-100H readouts. },

In this study, we measured the scintillating lights, which are altered by to the exposure parameters, such as the tube potential, current-time product, and focus-surface distance (FSD), with an \{SFOD\} placed on the top of an acrylic and aluminum chest phantom to provide a backscatter medium. The scintillating light signals of the \{SFOD\} were compared with the \{ESDs\} obtained using conventional dosimeters. The \{ESDs\} that were measured using the dose-area product (DAP) meter, as an indirect method, and a semiconductor dosimeter, as a direct method, were distinguished according to differences in the measurement position and the method used. In the case of the two direct methods with the \{SFOD\} and the semiconductor dosimeter, the output light signals of the \{SFOD\} were similar to the \{ESDs\} of the semiconductor dosimeter. It is expected that the \{SFOD\} will be a useful dosimeter for diagnostic radiology due to its many advantages, including its small size, lightweight, substantial flexibility, remote sensing, real-time monitoring, and immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI). },

The depth dose distributions in the detector were examined with regard of dose and dose rate dependences in the response. Our experimental results indicated that the dose response depended considerably on the depth from the incident position, and also the dose rate in the proton irradiation. We estimated the dose response at different depth of the incident proton beam from the depth-R2 relations with various dose, and the spread-out depth dose in a single field irradiation derived from these dose responses obtained the good agreement with a planned dose distribution. In conclusion, our method with \{MAGAT\} type polymer gel is effective in a quality assurance of fundamental reproducibility test for three dimensional radiation therapy planning system, such as monitor unit verification and standard isodose verification using a single field proton beam. However the depth dose distribution should be evaluated depending on irradiation dose rate, \{SOBP\} width, and maximum energy. },

  Abstract                 = {Radiation is known to be a major cause of cancer in normal tissue. After treatment with radiotherapy, for young patients or the patients can survive for a long time, the radiation-induced cancer risk is noteworthy. This research investigated the dose delivered by the treatment of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck cancer, such as \{NPC\} and oral cancer, and assessed the risk of developing radiation-induced secondary cancer in non-targeted normal tissues. A Rando phantom was used to simulate a patient with \{NPC\} or oral cancer, and thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) chips were placed inside the phantom to estimate the doses delivered by IMRT. In summary, the risks to patients with \{NPC\} was somewhat higher than for those with oral cancer, because the region of the \{PTV\} was lower, requiring larger field sizes be used for cases of NPC. The smaller the field size used, the less the risk was of developing secondary cancer. In addition, the higher the value of \{MU\} used, the higher the dose delivered to normal tissues was. The risk of radiation-induced secondary cancer was proportional to the delivered dose. },

The lognormal distributions generated more realistic distributions for the equilibrium factor F and the unattached fraction fp of the potential alpha energy concentration, and a much tighter relationship between F and Fp, when compared with the traditionally used uniform distributions.

  Abstract                 = {Dose perturbation caused by the Henschke applicator is a major concern for the brachytherapy planning system (BPS) in recent years. To investigate dose impact owing to neglect of the metal shielding effect, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, \{BPS\} calculation, and film measurement have been performed for dose assessment in a water phantom. Additionally, a cylindrical air cavity representing the rectum was added into the \{MC\} simulation to study its effect on dose distribution. Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP) was used in this study to simulate the dose distribution using a mesh tally. This Monte Carlo simulation has been validated using the TG-43 data in a previous report. For the measurement, the Henschke applicator was placed in a specially-designed phantom, and Gafchromic films were inserted in the center plane for 2D dose assessment. Isodose distributions with and without the Henschke applicator by the \{MC\} simulation show significant deviation from those by the BPS. For \{MC\} simulation, the isodose curves shrank more significantly when the metal applicator was applied. For the impact of the added air cavity, the results indicate that it is hard to distinguish between with and without the cavity. Thus, the rectum cavity has little impact on the dose distribution around the Henschke applicator. },

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this work is to investigate basic luminescence properties of BeO optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) detectors, including the \{OSL\} emission and stimulation spectrum, the lifetime of the luminescence centers contributing to the \{OSL\} signal, and the temperature dependence of the luminescence lifetime and of the luminescence efficiency. The \{OSL\} stimulation spectrum shows a continuous increase in \{OSL\} intensity with decreasing stimulation wavelength. The emission spectrum indicates two \{OSL\} emission bands at â¼310Â nm and â¼370Â nm, the latter being the dominant \{OSL\} emission band. We also observed that the luminescence centers associated with the \{OSL\} signal are strongly quenched above room temperature, resulting in a reduction in luminescence lifetime from â¼27Â Î¼s at room temperature down to â¼800Â ns at 140Â Â°C. The activation energy for non-radiative decay of the luminescence center was determined to be EÂ =Â (0.568Â Â±Â 0.023)Â eV. The â¼27Â Î¼s luminescence lifetime observed for BeO indicate that \{POSL\} technique may be used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio using stimulation pulses of the order of microseconds. The information obtained in this study may help further optimize the BeO dosimetry systems and provide guidance on the timing parameters to be used for \{POSL\} measurements of this material. },

  Abstract                 = {In this study, \{PSL\} of non-irradiated and irradiated corrugated fiberboards (CFs) was investigated to evaluate the possibility that \{CFs\} can be used as alternative specimens for the screening detection method of food irradiation. The irradiation at a dose of only 0.15Â kGy increased \{PSL\} signals of the \{CF\} over 1 order of magnitude. The \{PSL\} signals increased with increasing in gamma irradiation dose and became almost saturated at a dose of 5Â kGy. The core of \{CFs\} showed \{PSL\} signals sufficient for distinguishing irradiated from non-irradiated at least 6 months after irradiation even though the \{CF\} was exposed to light and the environmental temperature increased to 50Â Â°C. These results suggest that the \{PSL\} property of the core of \{CFs\} is useful for detecting irradiation. However, the large variation of \{PSL\} signals among \{CFs\} made it difficult to set a well-defined âpositiveâ threshold limit to distinguish irradiated from non-irradiated completely. All of the non-irradiated \{CFs\} showed \{PSL\} signals above 103 counts, which is much higher than that detected for foods. It is apparent that the threshold limit of \{EN\} 13751 is not applicable to detecting irradiated CFs. More detailed collaborative research with large number of samples is needed to establish new threshold limits involving âintermediateâ classification. },

  Abstract                 = {Long-term continuous in-situ radon field monitoring was carried out in the southern region of Israel, at the Amram Mountain research tunnel in Elat and in shallow boreholes in the Gevanim valley in Makhtesh Ramon. This work shows that long-term radon monitoring based on simultaneous alpha and gamma measurement enables to differentiate between the impact of ambient temperature and pressure on radon transportation within porous media both in sites isolated from outer meteorological influence as in the Amram tunnel and in sites open to the influence of environmental conditions as in the Gevanim boreholes array. It was found that if the monitoring site is a closed measuring space with undisturbed environmental conditions, the radon in the air space will reach equilibrium with the radon in the rock. Then the radon time series as measured by both gamma and alpha detectors exhibit the same temporal variations. The results in this case indicate that the diurnal, intra-seasonal and seasonal variations in the radon concentration are clearly associated with the ambient temperature gradient outside the rock air interface, 100Â m above the tunnel. In shallow, open boreholes, no equilibrium between the radon within the porous media and the radon in the open borehole air is necessarily established and the results of radon monitoring are different. Gamma detectors that measure the changes in radon concentrations in the porous rock indicated a clear correlation between radon concentrations and the daily variations of external surface temperature, from about 1Â m up to 85Â m. Yet the alpha detectors that measure the changes in radon concentrations in very shallow borehole air (about 1Â m) reveal a clear anti-correlation with atmospheric pressure waves at semi-daily, daily, and intra-seasonal time scales. At depths of several tens of meters, outer pressure waves induce anti-correlated radon variations lasting the same time, but destroy the ordered radon daily periodicity in the measuring air space, although almost not disturbing the daily radon variation within the surrounding porous media. },

To analyze the number of constituent glow peaks, we used a kinetic model to describe both the irradiation and heating stages.

  Abstract                 = {Medical physicists need dosimeters such as gel dosimeters capable of determining three-dimensional dose distributions with high spatial resolution. To date, in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), polyacrylamide gel (PAG) polymers are the most promising gel dosimetry systems. The purpose of this work was to investigate the dose rate dependency of the \{PAGAT\} gel dosimeter at low dose rates. The gel dosimeter was used for measurement of the dose distribution around a Cs-137 source from a brachytherapy \{LDR\} source to have a range of dose rates from 0.97 Gy hâ1 to 0.06 Gy hâ1. After irradiation of the \{PAGAT\} gel, it was observed that the dose measured by gel dosimetry was almost the same at different distances (different dose rates) from the source, although the points nearer the source had been expected to receive greater doses. Therefore, it was suspected that the \{PAGAT\} gel is dose rate dependent at low dose rates. To test this further, three other sets of measurements were performed by placing vials containing gel at different distances from a Cs-137 source. In the first two measurements, several plastic vials were exposed to equal doses at different dose rates. An ionization chamber was used to measure the dose rate at each distance. In addition, three \{TLD\} chips were simultaneously irradiated in order to verify the dose to each vial. In the third measurement, to test the oxygen diffusion through plastic vials, the experiment was repeated again using plastic vials in a nitrogen box and glass vials. The study indicates that oxygen diffusion through plastic vials for dose rates lower than 2 Gy hâ1 would affect the gel dosimeter response and it is suggested that the plastic vials or (phantoms) in an oxygen free environment or glass vials should be used for the dosimetry of low dose rate sources using \{PAGAT\} gel to avoid oxygen diffusion through the vials. },

The knowledge of the X-ray energy spectral distribution allows optimizing the radiographic imaging system in order to obtain high quality images with as low as reasonably achievable patient doses. In this study, transmitted X-ray spectra through dentin and enamel that are existing materials in intra-oral radiology were experimentally determined in an X-ray equipment with 40â70Â kV variable range. Dentin and enamel samples with 0.4â3.8 and 0.6â2.6Â mm thick were used as attenuators. X-ray transmitted spectra were measured with XR-100T model CdTe detector and half-value layers (HVL) were determined. Characteristics of both dentin and enamel transmitted spectra showed that they have differences in the penetration power in matter and in the spectrum distribution. The results will be useful for phantom developments based on dentin and enamel for image quality control in dental radiology. },

These imply the existence of two distinct emission sources (cold and hot source) of \{HPF\} in 84KrâH, CNO, AgBr and emulsion interactions. The dominant source is the cold one (projectile spectator source) with lower temperature and the other is hot one (projectile participant source) with higher temperature.

In this study, a new measuring system was developed to evaluate the size distribution of unattached radon progeny in air. In the system, airborne radon progeny were collected with a newly designed graded screen array (GSA), the activity concentrations were measured by using the imaging plate technique, and the size distribution of unattached fraction was retrieved by using an iterative nonlinear algorithm. The simulation results indicated that the collection characteristics of the new \{GSA\} system were well agreed with other systems. Test experiments showed that the activity-weighted median diameters (AMD) for unattached 218Po, 214Pb and 214Bi were 0.89Â Â±Â 0.11Â nm, 0.96Â Â±Â 0.13Â nm and 1.01Â Â±Â 0.25Â nm in a particle-free radon chamber, and the distribution changed with different concentrations of particles. As multiple measurements can be simultaneously carried out with a single IP, the new technique is considered as an optional and useful way to measure the size distribution measurement of unattached radon progeny. },

Measurement results of some survey meters depend on the neutron spectra characteristics in different neutron radiation fields, so the characteristics of the responses to various neutron spectra should be studied in order to get more reasonable dose. In this paper the responses of the survey meter were calculated under different neutron spectra data from \{IAEA\} of Technical Reports Series No. 318 and other references. Finally one dose estimation method was determined. The range of the reading per H*(10) for the method estimated is about 0.7â1.6 for the neutron mean energy range from 50Â keV to 300Â MeV. },

The counts of the Bonner spheres for \{IAEA\} neutron spectra were used as a database, and the artificial neural network and the maximum entropy method were used to unfold neutron spectra; the mean squares of the spectra were defined as the differences between the desired and unfolded spectra. After the information entropy of each spectrum was calculated using information entropy theory, the relationship between the mean squares of the spectra and the information entropy was acquired. Useful information from the information entropy guided the selection of unfolding methods. Due to the importance of the information entropy, the method for predicting the information entropy using the Bonner spheres' counts was established.

  Abstract                 = {In proton therapy neutrons are introduced to out-of-field regions inside the patient. Clinicians would like to know the absorbed dose being deposited by neutrons separately to that from protons, so as to be able to directly apply their own dose equivalent weighting factors based on their opinion of the biological risk posed by neutrons in this region. The purpose of this study is to investigate a novel approach to experimentally separating the proton and neutron contributions to the absorbed dose in out-of-field regions. The method pairs specially designed silicon \{PIN\} diodes with a standard clinical ionization chamber. The sensitivity of the Si diode to non-ionizing energy losses in silicon is exploited, and can be quantified by measuring the shift in forward voltage for a fixed injection current, pre and post irradiation. The mathematical relations that describe the response of the diode and the ionization chamber can be solved simultaneously to give the contributions to the absorbed dose from protons and neutrons separately. Experimental measurements were made at the Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), Loma Linda, and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, proton therapy facilities. Experimental separation of the partial proton and neutron contributions to the absorbed dose measured at positions lateral to a typical prostate therapy treatment field delivered to a Lucite phantom was successfully performed and compared with results from a \{GEANT4\} simulation. The experimental results matched well with simulation confirming the validity and promise of the novel approach. },

However, it is also characterized by the introduction of a large number of uncertainties. To assess these uncertainties, we decided to proceed under a Bayesian approach. The Bayesian approach is characterized by the formalization of the initial assumptions (prior). Thus, this approach can test the relevance of the different (expressed or implied) assumptions used to assess the dose. In the present communication, we focus on the relationship between the accumulated dose and the luminescence measurements in two cases: single aliquot regeneration and multiple aliquots additive dose methods. The aim is to see how the Bayesian approach can reduce the use of arbitrary criteria. },

To test the actual dose rate inside our laboratory room, an investigation combining portable dose rate meter, portable NaI(Tl) gamma spectrometry, and blue-OSL dosimetry using Al2O3:C pellets was made. Although our measurements show the presence of X-rays as far as 3Â m from the sources, the dose rates are below the safety regulation and does not affect the dating of the sample stored in the same room as the radioactive sources. },

  Abstract                 = {Archaeological fragments of pottery have been investigated by using CW-EPR and Echo Detected \{EPR\} (EDEPR). \{EDEPR\} allows to remove the CW-EPR dominant Fe(III) background spectrum, hiding much weaker signals potentially useful for dating purpose. \{EDEPR\} spectra attributed to a methyl radical and to feldspar defects have been recorded at room and low temperature for an Iron Age cooking ware (700 B.C.). A study on the dependence of \{EDEPR\} intensity over absorbed dose on a series of Î³-irradiated brick samples (estimated age of 562Â Â±Â 140 B.C.) has confirmed the potential efficacy of the proposed method for spotting defect signals out of the strong iron background. },

The absorption, cathodoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra and photoluminescence decay curves were measured for the \{SCFs\} with different doping levels of Er3+ (from 0.6 to 4.2 at.%) and Yb3+ (from 0.1 to 0.6 at.%). The spectra, excited by synchrotron radiation in the fundamental absorption range of the \{YAG\} and in the intraionic absorption bands of both dopants, reveal energy transfer from the \{YAG\} host to the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions and between these ions. },

Sands from older beach ridges (ages older than 2000 years ago) show higher \{OSL\} and \{TL\} sensitivities than younger units (ages younger than 2000 years). Geomorphological units in the \{SFS\} attest to changes in provenance as a result of a coastal climate shift evidenced through grain size and heavy mineral analysis. We argue that in the \{SFS\} barrier sands, \{OSL\} and \{TL\} sensitivity signals provide an additional proxy to climate events and can be used as an alternative method to assess changes in provenance and tracking source-to-sink systems to monitor past and future environmental changes. },
