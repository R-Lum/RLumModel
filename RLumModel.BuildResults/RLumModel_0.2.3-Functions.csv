"model_LuminescenceSignals","Model Luminescence Signals","This function models luminescence signals for quartz based on published physical models. It is possible to simulate TL, (CW-) OSL, RF measurements in a arbitrary sequence. This sequence is definded as a  list  of certain abrivations. Furthermore it is possible to load a sequence direct from the Riso Sequence Editor. The output is an  RLum.Analysis object and so the plots are done by the  plot_RLum.Analysis  function. If a SAR sequence is simulated the plot output can be disabled and SAR analyse functions can be used.","0.1.4","2017-10-17","13:48:47
