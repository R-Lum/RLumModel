"model_LuminescenceSignals","Model Luminescence Signals","<br /> This function models luminescence signals for quartz based on published physical models.<br /> It is possible to simulate TL, (CW-) OSL, RF measurements in a arbitrary sequence. This<br /> sequence is definded as a  list  of certain abrivations. Furthermore it is possible to<br /> load a sequence direct from the Riso Sequence Editor.<br /> The output is an  RLum.Analysis object and so the plots are done<br /> by the  plot_RLum.Analysis  function. If a SAR sequence is simulated the plot output can be disabled and SAR analyse functions<br /> can be used.<br />","0.1.0
