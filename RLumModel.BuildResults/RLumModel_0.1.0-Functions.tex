1 & model\_LuminescenceSignals & Model Luminescence Signals & $<$br /$>$ This function models luminescence signals for quartz based on published physical models.$<$br /$>$ It is possible to simulate TL, (CW-) OSL, RF measurements in a arbitrary sequence. This$<$br /$>$ sequence is definded as a list of certain abrivations. Furthermore it is possible to$<$br /$>$ load a sequence direct from the Riso Sequence Editor.$<$br /$>$ The output is an RLum.Analysis object and so the plots are done by the plot\_RLum.Analysis$<$br /$>$ function. If a SAR sequence is simulated the plot output can be disabled and SAR analyse functions$<$br /$>$ can be used.$<$br /$>$ & 0.1.0
