"model_LuminescenceSignals","Model Luminescence Signals","This function models luminescence signals for quartz based on published physical models. It is possible to simulate TL, (CW-) OSL, RF measurements in a arbitrary sequence. This sequence is defined as a  list  of certain aberrations. Furthermore it is possible to load a sequence direct from the Ris√∏ Sequence Editor. The output is an  Luminescence::RLum.Analysis  object and so the plots are done by the  Luminescence::plot_RLum.Analysis  function. If a SAR sequence is simulated the plot output can be disabled and SAR analyse functions can be used.","0.1.6
