NEWS for the R Package RLumModel

Changes in version 0.1.2 (2nd September, 2016):

  Bugfixes and changes::

         • added vignette():

             • Added vignette 'Getting started with RLumModel'.

         • set_ODE():

             • Remove 'b', 'temp', 'R' and 'P' from unpacking, because
               these parameters are already stored in parameters.step.

             • Remove distinction of cases 'model = Pagonis' or 'model
               = Bailey' due to a misstake in Bailey 2001, 2002 and
               2004. The rate equation for the valence band is wrong.
               Thanks to an unknown reviewer of Friedrich et al. 2016.

         • set_ODE_LM_OSL():

             • Remove 'a', 'b', 'temp', 'R' and 'P' from unpacking,
               because these parameters are already stored in
               parameters.step.

               = Bailey' due to a misstake in Bailey 2001, 2002 and

         • simulate_CW_OSL():

             • Changed ode solver to 'ode' with method 'bdf' for faster
               solving long illumination times.

         • simulate_illumination():

             • Changed ode solver to 'ode' with method 'bdf' for faster
               solving long illumination times.

         • simulate_irradiation():

             • Changed choice of pair-production-rate 'R', so that
               Bailey 2004 has the right value of 2.5e10.

         • simulate_LM_OSL():

             • Changed ode solver to 'ode' with method 'bdf' for faster
               solving long illumination times.

         • simulate_RF():

             • Changed choice of pair-production-rate 'R', so that
               Bailey 2004 has the right value of 2.5e10.

Changes in version 0.1.1 (2nd May, 2016):

        • Changed tests because of new package structure of 'testthat'.

Changes in version 0.1.0 (3rd February, 2016):

        • Initial version.
