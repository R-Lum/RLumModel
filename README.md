The **R** package ‘RLumModel’ by Johannes Friedrich (University of
Bayreuth, Germany), Sebastian Kreutzer (IRAMAT-CRP2A, Université
Bordeaux Montaigne, France) and Christoph Schmidt (University of
Bayreuth, Germany) provides a collection of various R functions
modelling luminescence signals in quartz and
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, based on energy-band models.
