The **R** package `'RLumModel'` by Johannes Friedrich (University of Bayreuth, Germany), 
Sebastian Kreutzer (Geography & Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom) and Christoph Schmidt 
(University of Lausanne, Switzerland)
provides a collection of various R functions modelling luminescence signals in quartz and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, based on energy-band models.

For an introduction and further details, visit the [RLumModel homepage](https://r-lum.github.io/RLumModel/).

## Installation

### Install the package

To install the stable version from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("RLumModel")
```

To install the latest development builds directly from GitHub, run

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("R-Lum/RLumModel@master")
```

To install a developer build other than 'master', replace the term 'master' in the codeline by the name
of the wanted developer build. 

### Requirements 

Depending on your OS please download and install one of the following:

* *Windows*: [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (provided by CRAN)
* *macOS*: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (provided by Apple)
* *Linux*: [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) often comes pre-installed in most distributions. Should [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org) be not available, however, we kindly refer to the exhaustive collection of installation guides depending on the Linux distribution.

## Using RLumModel

### Simple Example

```{r}
model <- "Bailey2001"

sequence <- list(
    IRR = c(20, 10, 1),
    TL = c(20, 500, 5))
    
model.output <- model_LuminescenceSignals(
    model = model,
    sequence = sequence,
    verbose = FALSE
)
```

## <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-euro"></span> Funding

The [development of RLumModel](https://github.com/R-Lum/RLumModel)
benefited from the support by various funding bodies:

-   The initial work by Johannes Friedrich, Sebastian Kreutzer and
    Christoph Schmidt was supported by the DFG (2015–2018, SCHM
    3051/4-1, “Modelling quartz luminescence signal dynamics relevant
    for dating and dosimetry”, SCHM
    3051/4-1)

-   The work of Sebastian Kreutzer as package author was
    supported by LabEx LaScArBx (ANR -
    n. ANR-10-LABX-52) between
    2017 and 2019.

-   From 2020, Sebastian Kreutzer received funding from the European
    Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the
    Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 844457 (project: CREDit).
